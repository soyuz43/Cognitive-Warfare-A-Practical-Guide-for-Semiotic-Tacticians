### ✦ **Tactic: Semantic Hijacking**

- **Unique Feature:** Reclaims a term or frame mid-discourse and injects it with altered meaning or recursive ambiguity.

- **Strategic Use:** Ideal for redirecting the flow of a conversation by seizing shared language and corrupting or recontextualizing its semantic load.

- **Heuristic Risk:** Overuse may trigger defensive entrenchment or semantic nullification.

- **Field Comment:** Useful in low-frame-saturation zones or when reclaiming compromised terminology (e.g., "AGI", "alignment", "optimism").

#### ⫸ **Target Layering**

- **Primary:** Lexical Anchors  
- **Secondary:** Conceptual Frames  
- **Tertiary:** Affective Associations

---

#### ⫸ **Operational Blueprint**

1. **Identify target term** – Look for shared or loaded terminology (e.g., “AGI optimist”).  
2. **Infiltrate semantic field** – Agree with or echo the term superficially.  
3. **Rewrite from within** – Subtly shift its definition, expand its frame, or embed recursive ambiguity.  
4. **Force downstream re-anchoring** – Interlocutors must either accept your frame or abandon the term entirely.

#### ⫸ **Ideal Terrain**

- **Ideologically unanchored discussions**  
- **Post-rupture interpretive fields** (see: Lateral Fracture)  
- **Discourse where memetic terms are in play but not yet defended**

---

#### ⫸ **Contraindications**

- **Heavily defined institutional contexts** (e.g., academic panels)  
- **Legal or formal language environments**  
- **Conversations with rigid semantic boundary enforcers**

### ✦ **Weapon Pairing Suggestions**

- **Ontological Whiplash** – Destabilize surrounding structures before hijack  
- **Temporal Disruption** – Delay reframing just long enough to embed the altered vector  
- **Dunning-Kruger Inversion** – Camouflage hijack behind perceived epistemic modesty

### ✦ **Status**

- **Codename:** _Viral Definition Vector_  
- **Classification:** Standard Tactical  
- **First Field Use:** Implied within 2025.05.19 Discord thread — AGI Optimism reframing
