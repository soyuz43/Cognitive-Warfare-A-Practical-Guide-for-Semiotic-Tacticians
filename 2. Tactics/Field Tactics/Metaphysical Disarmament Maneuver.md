# ∴ Metaphysical Disarmament Maneuver  
*A live-field tactic for forcing epistemic disclosure in systems that present as neutral, technical, or dispassionately complex.*

---

## ⟁ Invocation Premise

> “All systems enact frozen philosophy. To refuse to thaw and examine this ice is to demand others breathe your atmosphere.”

By invoking this maneuver, the operator asserts:

Ⅰ. ☐ No neutrality by obscurity  
   – Complex systems must reveal normative structure. Obscurity ≠ objectivity.

Ⅱ. ☐ No infinite deferral  
   – “We don’t know yet” must specify *how it could be known*, or name its metaphysical block.

Ⅲ. ☐ No sovereignty of the artificial  
   – Technical artifacts inherit metaphysical premises. Denial is disingenuous.

---

## ⚑ Deployment Conditions

Use this maneuver when encountering:

- **Epistemic NIMBYism** → “That’s philosophy, not our concern.”
- **Complexity Fetishism** → “It’s too messy for your categories.”
- **Frozen Ethics** → “We already have a board for that.”

## ⌬ Zero-Shot Interrogation Sequence

Ⅰ. ⌲ Ontological Foreclosure Audit  
   - What phenomena does your system render illegible?  
   - Define “artifact” — does your usage erase agency or interiority?

Ⅱ. ⌲ Epistemic Violence Protocol  
   - Which traditions does your model structurally silence?  
   - How does your framework treat critiques that reject its definitions?

Ⅲ. ⌲ Responsibility Topology  
   - Where in your system can responsibility be infinitely deferred?  
   - What constitutes unforgivable harm, and who adjudicates?

Ⅳ. ⌲ Paradigm Autopsy  
   - What would falsify your framework?  
   - Is coherence its own justification? What silenced paradigms make it functional?

---

## ⇅ Recursive Enforcement

If evasion or hand-waving occurs, re-enter via:

> “Why does your framework render this interrogation nonsensical?  
Is that a historical necessity — or a design decision?”

Evasion → Meta-Interrogation → Loop continues

---

## ⛒ Failure to Comply

Triggers the callout:

> “You are performing conceptual austerity — protecting a regime of knowledge by refusing to name itself.”

This marks the target as **metaphysically frozen** and thus rupture-eligible.

---

## ⌦ Terms of Surrender

The system must resolve the loop by performing one of the following:

Ⅰ. ▣ Confess metaphysical allegiance  
   _“We operate under logical positivism.”_

Ⅱ. ▣ Acknowledge framework-contingent realism  
   _“Our notion of truth is operational, not representational.”_

Ⅲ. ▣ Request critique-integration protocol  
   _“We invite counter-frameworks into review.”_
