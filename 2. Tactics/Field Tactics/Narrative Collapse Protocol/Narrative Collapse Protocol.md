# Narrative Collapse Protocol  
*A field maneuver for weaponized overload of symbolic coherence fields through recursive contradiction, tempo distortion, and interpretive fragmentation.*

## ⟁ Tactical Classification
- **Domain:** Field Tactics → Cognitive Disruption
- **Codename:** Blackout Weft
- **Weapon Class:** ⚠️ Volatile-Class – Cognitive
- **Tactical Tier:** Disarmament Tier II / Destabilization

## ✦ Operational Premise

> “Every narrative contains its own collapse vector — find the seam, amplify the drift, and rupture its continuity.”

This protocol is used to collapse dominant or adversarial narrative architectures by:
- Introducing recursive contradiction
- Destabilizing temporal or causal cohesion
- Forcing interpretive saturation or implosion

---

## ⫸ Deployment Conditions

- **Narrative rigidity** that prevents reparative discourse  
- **Uninterrogated coherence** masquerading as neutrality or consensus  
- **Overcohered frames** that bind opponents to structural gaslighting

---

## ⫸ Phase Structure

### I. Frame Saturation
- **Flood shared narrative container** with hypercoherence or expanded details
- Overdescribe, overconnect — increase semantic gravity until structural fatigue emerges

### II. Tempo Derailment
- **Manipulate narrative pacing**
  - Inject urgency, drag, or recursive time warps
  - Collapse cause-effect assumptions (e.g., "when did this start vs. when was it noticed?")

### III. Recursive Contradiction Layering
- Identify core narrative assertions
- Reflect them through mirrored or inverted logic structures
- Allow inconsistencies to compound without explicit resolution

### IV. Symbolic Overload
- Reintroduce previously excluded symbolic data (e.g., silenced voices, erased events)
- Force narrative to account for suppressed material within its own architecture

---

## ⫸ Interrogation Vector Template

> “What part of this story would falsify the whole thing?”  
> “Where is harm placed outside narrative resolution?”  
> “What *can’t* this frame account for without folding?”

Use as ignition prompts when narrative fatigue or boundary policing emerges.

## ⫸ Post-Collapse Maneuvers

After successful narrative collapse:
- Deploy [[Lateral Fracture Maneuver]] for targeted discourse rupture  
- Transition to [[Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol — Dialectic Re-entry Scaffolding]] if repair is desirable  
- Use [[Symbolic Debris Field Analysis]] to extract residual artifacts for reframing

---

## ✦ Contraindications

- **Narratives held as trauma containers** (may trigger defensive escalation)  
- **Dialogues requiring shared repair** — collapse without scaffolding burns trust  
- **Low-tension zones** — may appear erratic or paranoid if not justified by field context

---

## ⫸ Symbolic Markers of Collapse

- Sudden redefinition of core terms  
- Shift from “what happened” to “what *counts* as happening”  
- Onset of narrative stammering or polysemic spiral (e.g., “it’s just… it’s more complicated”)
