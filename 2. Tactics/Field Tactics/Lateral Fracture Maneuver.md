### ✦ **Tactic: Lateral Fracture Maneuver**

- **Unique Feature:** Induces destabilization by infiltrating before coherence forms.
    
- **Strategic Use:** Forces adversaries to respond before constructing a stable epistemic frame.
    
- **Heuristic Risk:** If the target has recursive stabilizers, tactic may backfire into reflexive hardening.
    
- **Field Comment:** Ideal when timing allows pre-frame occupation; creates asymmetric interpretive terrain.

#### ⫸ **Target Layering**

- **Primary:** Epistemic Framing
    
- **Secondary:** Temporal Orientation
    
- **Tertiary:** Narrative Coherence

#### ⫸ **Operational Blueprint**

1. **Ingress via soft flank** – Identify under-defended belief or assumption cluster.
    
2. **Execute cognitive J-hook** – Maneuver behind interpretive expectations.
    
3. **Enforce bidirectional strain** – Create semantic tension from multiple interpretive axes.
    
4. **Avoid epistemic entrenchment** – Withdraw if enemy begins to frame you into coherence.

#### ⫸ **Ideal Terrain**

- **High-context, low-saturation discourse zones** (early argument stages)
    
- **Multi-agent forums** where frame-stabilization lag is exploitable
    
- **Mediated dialogues** where initial momentum shapes the epistemic field
    

---

#### ⫸ **Contraindications**

- **Stable authoritarian systems** with monolithic framing agents
    
- **Highly recursive metadialogues** that absorb disruption via narrative elasticity
    
- **Environments with pre-attached interpretive valence** (e.g., tribunal settings)
    

---

### ✦ **Weapon Pairing Suggestions**

- **Semantic Hijacking** – After destabilization, rewrite interpretive vectors
    
- **Temporal Disruption** – Layer delayed-response cues to prolong destabilization
    
- **Narrative Collapse** – If framing resists, sever structure entirely
    

---

### ✦ **Status**

- **Codename:** _Blade Before Frame_
    
- **Classification:** Standard Tactical
    
- **Last Field Use:** Simulated in adversarial panel test (2024.11)

Want to begin outlining the **next maneuver** (e.g., Pavlov’s House / fixed-point recursion defense)? Or should we sketch the **Meta-Structural Overview** for the _Tactics_ section first?
