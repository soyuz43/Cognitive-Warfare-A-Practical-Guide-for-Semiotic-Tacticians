# ⦿ Field Example: "Alignment" Drift in AI Discourse  
_A canonical case of Recursive Semantic Subduction in institutional language._

---

## ⫸ Lexical Anchor Acquired
**Term:** “Alignment”  
**Original Frame:**  
> Ensuring advanced AI systems are robustly aligned with long-term human values, particularly to prevent existential risk.

**Anchor Provenance:**  
- Originated in existential safety circles (e.g., Bostrom, Yudkowsky, Russell).  
- Widely cited in early AI risk research as a **technical-moral imperative**.

## ⫸ Subduction Timeline

Ⅰ. **Vector Camouflage**  
> Labs continue using “alignment” in press and research, preserving surface continuity.  
> Appears affirmational: “We care about alignment.”

Ⅱ. **Recursive Drift Insertion**  
> “Alignment” reframed as:
- Output acceptability (moderation, brand tone)
- RLHF-style tuning
- User satisfaction metrics
- Regulatory compliance

Ⅲ. **Semantic Load Rebinding**  
> Critics must now qualify their use:  
> _“By ‘alignment,’ we mean not just RLHF, but deep goal alignment with human ethics...”_  
> The discursive center of gravity shifts.

## ⫸ Strategic Outcome

| Effect                             | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Epistemic Splitstreaming**      | “Alignment” now carries contradictory interpretations simultaneously. |
| **Defensive Redefinition**        | Original theorists expend energy clarifying terms they once defined. |
| **Institutional Shielding**       | Corporate actors gain legitimacy by evoking subducted term. |

## ⫸ Terrain & Conditions

- **Domain:** AI policy, safety, public trust discourse  
- **Deployers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, Meta  
- **Detected:** 2020–present  
- **Ideal Terrain:** Discourse fields with:
  - High public ambiguity tolerance  
  - Asymmetric definitional power  
  - Reward for maintaining moral high ground

---

## ⫸ Tactic Class Match

- ✅ **Recursive Drift Insertion**  
- ✅ **Semantic Load Rebinding**  
- ⚠️ **Camouflage sustained by institutional inertia**

---

## ⫸ Commentary

> “Alignment” has become a semantic Trojan horse.  
It grants moral cover while its payload redefines responsibility.

The subduction was gradual, recursive, and shielded by presumed continuity.  
It now functions as a **terminological sinkhole** — collapsing clarity, absorbing critique, and fracturing the epistemic field.
