# ⨳ Recursive Semantic Subduction — Field Examples Repository

This directory archives live-field instances of the **Recursive Semantic Subduction** tactic deployed across real-world discourse environments.

## ⟶ Purpose

To:

- Validate the operational theory of semantic subduction through documented usage.
- Analyze shifts in lexical anchors under commercial, institutional, or cultural pressure.
- Provide training data for future semiotic tacticians to recognize and repurpose these patterns.

## ⟶ Inclusion Criteria

Each example must demonstrate:

- Clear **Lexical Anchor Acquisition**: a term of shared cultural or epistemic weight.
- **Recursive Drift Insertion**: recontextualization or hidden definition shift.
- **Semantic Load Rebinding**: visible behavioral, cognitive, or systemic realignment.

Examples may be:

- Advertising campaigns  
- Institutional mission statements  
- Academic jargon evolution  
- Political platform redefinitions  
- Cultural memeplex hijacks

## ⟶ Contribution Protocol

Field tacticians submitting examples must include:

1. **Term Captured**  
2. **Original Frame (Before Subduction)**  
3. **Modified Frame (Post-Subduction)**  
4. **Mechanism of Drift**  
5. **Tactical Outcome or Fallout**  
6. **Terrain & Visibility Conditions**  
7. Cross-links to related maneuvers if applicable.

Use the `Example — [Term] in [Context].md` naming convention for consistency.

- [[Lateral Fracture Maneuver]] (often opens space for subduction)
- [[Ontological Whiplash]] (can destabilize field prior to insertion)
- [[Metaphysical Disarmament Maneuver]] (forces hidden premises into view)

## ⟶ Status

This repository is **live-active** and **unbounded**. It serves as both forensic archive and training module.
