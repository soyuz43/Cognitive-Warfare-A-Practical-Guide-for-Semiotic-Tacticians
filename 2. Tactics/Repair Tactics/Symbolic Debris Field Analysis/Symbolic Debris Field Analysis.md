# Symbolic Debris Field Analysis  
*A post-collapse analytical protocol for mapping ruptured semiotic terrain and isolating salvageable narrative components.*

---

## ⟁ Tactical Classification

- **Domain:** Repair Tactics → Post-Rupture Reconstruction  
- **Codename:** Mnemonic Scavenger  
- **Tactical Tier:** Post-Collapse Phase I  
- **Status:** Repair–Class Recon Protocol

---

## ✦ Operational Premise

> “After the narrative implodes, what lingers isn't noise — it's orphaned meaning, still looking for a grammar.”

This protocol is activated following narrative collapse, memetic rupture, or semantic overload. It allows operators to:

- Identify residual symbolic artifacts  
- Classify surviving metaphors, frames, or axioms  
- Reconstruct local coherence using fragments without reactivating collapsed structure

---

## ⫸ Activation Conditions

- Completion of [[Narrative Collapse Protocol]]  
- Discursive breakdowns due to recursive contradiction  
- Drift fields following memetic detonation or social implosion

---

## ⫸ Phased Analysis Sequence

### I. Symbolic Fragment Survey  
Scan remaining dialogue or memory traces for:
- Isolated metaphors
- Unresolved loops
- Terminological fragments that still hold affective charge

### II. Residual Coherence Mapping  
Trace how fragments relate to one another:
- Are they gravitationally linked around a lost center?  
- Do they seek repair, redirection, or retributive coherence?

Map:
- **Anchored debris** → still seeks meaning via shared context  
- **Drifting shards** → dissociated, non-functional, emotionally charged

### III. Axiom Extraction  
Ask:
> “What belief systems were embedded in the structure that collapsed — and which remain uncollapsed?”

Attempt to name:
- Dormant priors  
- Hidden axioms that still dictate interpretation patterns  
- Leftover scaffolds that may stabilize a new paradigm

---

## ⫸ Reuse Protocols

- **Memetic Reforging** → Integrate fragments into new framework without activating trauma-vectors  
- **Rupture-to-Reframe Loop** → Use surviving shards as bridge for alternate framing  
- **Symbolic Composting** → Let high-toxicity fragments decay before reuse (temporal quarantine)

---

## ✦ Contraindications

- Premature analysis may misclassify trauma residue as coherence  
- Attempting full restoration of original narrative risks reactivating collapse vector  
- Requires discursive space to breathe — not ideal in high-velocity conflict fields

---

## ⫸ Field Heuristics

- What remains emotionally charged but semantically hollow?  
- Which fragments reappear across dialogues post-collapse?  
- Are survivors anchoring new meaning or reciting mnemonic residue?

- [[Cultural Drift Weaponization]]  
- [[Narrative Collapse Protocol]]
