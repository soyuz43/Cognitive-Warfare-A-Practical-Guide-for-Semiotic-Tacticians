# ✦ Repair Protocol: Post-LFM Engagement

_Repair protocol for restoring semantic integrity following deployment of the Lateral Fracture Maneuver (codename: Blade Before Frame)._

---

### ⫸ **Trigger Conditions**
- LFM was executed successfully OR
- LFM resulted in partial destabilization with adversary reflexively stabilizing

---

### ⫸ **Repair Objectives**
- Neutralize semantic turbulence induced by pre-frame disruption
- Re-integrate observers without cementing interpretive bias
- Prevent retroactive narrative hardening (by either party)

---

### ⫸ **Phase 1: Frame Suspension**

> “Clarity is not urgency — allow interpretive drift.”

- Enact a **soft silence window** (2–5 minutes or ~500 tokens delay) in public channels
- Discourage immediate explanatory framing
- Allow adversary or observers to vocalize unease without contestation

---

### ⫸ **Phase 2: Multi-Frame Reflection**

> “Ask what the fracture revealed, not what it proved.”

- Pose reflective prompts to allies (examples):
  - “What assumptions were displaced?”
  - “What frames tried to reassert themselves?”
  - “What remained stable?”
- Avoid single-narrative synthesis

---

### ⫸ **Phase 3: Semantic Weaving**

> “Weave without sealing.”

- Introduce layered narrative threads — *not* unified conclusions
- Acknowledge tactical rupture as **incomplete gesture**, not total victory
- Embed references to previous structures with **ironic distance**

---

### ⫸ **Stabilization Cues**

- Use metaphor or poetic scaffolding over declarative interpretation
- Signal **re-entry points** for adversary engagement (non-escalatory)
- Reinforce that **meaning is provisional**

---

### ✦ Codename: _Soft Reframe Aftershocks_
**Classification:** Tactical Repair  
**Version:** 0.9 (Pre-battlefield Validation)
