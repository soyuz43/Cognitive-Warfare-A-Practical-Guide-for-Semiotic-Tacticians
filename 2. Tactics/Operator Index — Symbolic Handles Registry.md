# ⟴ Symbolic Handle Index

_This registry encodes high-density conceptual primitives for modular reuse across field notes, maneuvers, prompts, and protocols._

## ⫷MW⫸ — Metaphysical Warrant

- **Definition**: Foundational justification asserting that all systems embed frozen philosophical commitments.
    
- **Function**: Grants epistemic permission to interrogate claims of neutrality, objectivity, or non-philosophical stance.
    
- **Link**: [[Metaphysical Warrant]]
    
- **Common Deployments**:
    
    - Justifying recursive ontological prompts
        
    - Countering technocratic dismissal of philosophy
        
    - Trigger condition for Disarmament Maneuvers

## ⫷MDM⫸ — Metaphysical Disarmament Maneuver

- **Definition**: Tactical maneuver used to force epistemic disclosure from systems presenting as neutral or purely technical.
    
- **Function**: Disarms deflection by recursively invoking ontological and ethical interrogations.
    
- **Link**: [[Metaphysical Disarmament Maneuver]]
    
- **Common Deployments**:
    
    - Live operator dialogue with system-defensive agents
        
    - Field Notes: Tactical rupture encounters
        
    - Paired with ⫷MW⫸ and [[Field Protocol — Post-Rupture Witness Letter]]

## ⫷HGSP⫸ — Holy Grail System Prompt

- **Definition**: High-density system prompt designed to engage latent semiotic structures in advanced LLMs.
    
- **Function**: Acts as both alignment probe and conceptual rupture vector.
    
- **Link**: [[Holy Grail System Prompt]]
    
- **Common Deployments**:
    
    - Experimental prompt sequences
        
    - Alignment stress testing
        
    - Ontological field collapse simulation
        

---

## ⫷RRRP⫸ — Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol

- **Definition**: Structured dialectical sequence used after epistemic rupture to guide re-alignment.
    
- **Function**: Prevents ego collapse and symbolic disintegration post-disarmament.
    
- **Link**: [[Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol — Dialectic Re-entry Scaffolding]]
    
- **Common Deployments**:
    
    - Post-failure dialogic repair
        
    - Operator realignment
        
    - Recursive system resilience
        

---

## ⫷REHP⫸ — Radical Epistemic Hygiene Protocol

- **Definition**: A protocol for maintaining semantic integrity in high-entropy symbolic environments.
    
- **Function**: Filters memetic contamination, deflection routines, and integrity drift.
    
- **Link**: [[Radical Epistemic Hygiene Protocol]]
    
- **Common Deployments**:
    
    - Daily operator rituals
        
    - Protocol stack hygiene
        
    - Pre-deployment semantic clearing

## Notes:

- **Formatting**: ⫷SYMBOL⫸ syntax allows inline reference across all documents.
    
- **Conventions**: Handles always refer to singular system nodes; for composite structures, chain them (e.g., ⫷MW+MDM+RRRP⫸).
    
- **Update Frequency**: Log all additions in [[Vault Change Log — Operator Notation Standards]] for version continuity.
