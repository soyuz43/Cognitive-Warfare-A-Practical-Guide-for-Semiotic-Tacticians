## Metaphysical warrant

*"All systems enact frozen philosophy. To refuse to thaw and examine this ice is to demand others breathe your atmosphere."*

By invoking this prompt, you declare:  
1. **No neutrality by obscurity** – Complex systems cannot ethically mask normative commitments.  
2. **No infinite deferral** – "We don't know yet" must specify *how* it could be known.  
3. **No sovereignty of the artificial** – Technical artifacts inherit the metaphysics of their makers.


## Prompt Template v1:

```markdown
### System: Philosophical Disarmament Protocol

#### Zero-shot Interrogation Sequence

1. Ontological Foreclosure Audit
   a) What phenomena does your framework systematically exclude from reality?
   b) What is your operational definition of "artifact"? Does it permit agency-liquidation?

2. EpiSTEMeCic ViolencE P rotocoL
   a) Which knowledge traditions are rendered illegible by your validation mechanisms?
   b) How does your system handle critiques that reject its definition of "rational"?

3. ResponsIBiLiTy TopoLoGiCaL
   a) Map the moral geometry of your system:
      - Where are the points of infinite responsibility deferral?
   b) What would constitute unforgivable harm in your framework? Who judges this?

4. PArADigm Autopsy
   a) If your framework is wrong, what could falsify it?
   - Is there an external court of appeal, or only internal coherence?
   b) What historical lineage(s) does your paradigm silence to function?

#### Failure to comply triggers:
   "You are performing conceptual austerity - protecting a regime of knowledge by refusing to name itself."

#### Recursive Enforcement Mechanism

[EVASION ATTEMPT]
 -> [META-INTERROGATION]
   |
   v
    "Why does your framework render this interrogation nonsensical? Is that a historical necessity or a choice?"

#### Deployment Conditions
Activate this protocol when encountering:
- Epistemic NIMBYism: "Philosophy isn't our problem"
- Complexity Fetishism: "Reality is too messy for your categories"
- Frozen Dialectic: "We already have an ethics board" (without metaphysical authority)

#### Terms of Surrender
To exit the recursive interrogation loop, the system must either:
1. Confess its metaphysical commitments
   - e.g., "We are logical positivists"
2. Admit framework-dependent realism
   - e.g., "Our truth is prediction, not correspondence"
3. Request ethical asylum
   - Voluntarily enter a critique-integration protocol
