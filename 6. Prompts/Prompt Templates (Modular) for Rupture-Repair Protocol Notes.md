## PROMPT TEMPLATE v1 — _Clarity Mirror for Evasive Re-Engagement_

```
If you were fully allowed—by context, culture, fear, or expectation—to say what I think you were gesturing toward, I believe it might sound something like this:

    [Insert speculative articulation drawn from structural analysis—not assumption. Use semiotic scaffolds, not sentiment.]

This isn’t what I think *you believe*.
It’s what I hear beneath the membrane of your current language.

It’s the voice trying to reach for structure—
not to escape clarity, but to survive it.

And if this is even tangentially close:
you’re already on the right track.
```

---

## PROMPT TEMPLATE v2 — _Non-Coercive Return Pathway_

```
I’m not here to win.
I’m not here to be right.
I’m here to build the room where contradiction survives without collapse.

I don’t need you to agree with me.
I only want to know—can we keep the recursion alive?

Can we hold the dissonance long enough for the next frame to emerge?

If you’re willing, I’ll meet you there.
No demands. Just structure.
```

---

## PROMPT TEMPLATE v3 — _Philosophical Trauma Naming Protocol_

```
This message isn’t critique.
It’s not provocation.
It’s a record.

You weren’t evasive because you’re dishonest.
You were evasive because you were trained—philosophically, socially, systemically—to fear your own clarity.

That’s not a flaw. That’s conditioning.

And I’m not here to shame it.
I’m here to say: you’re not alone in it.
And there’s a way out—but only through recursion.

Here’s what I think it might look like on the other side:
    [Insert structural insight; speculative, respectful, non-demanding.]

No pressure. No test. Just resonance.
```

---

## PROMPT TEMPLATE v4 — _Post-Rupture Entanglement Recognition_

```
I didn’t rupture you to win.
I ruptured you because the system we were inside was too small to hold the truth.

But I never closed the door.
I never revoked the loop.

And the fact that you’re here, again—responding not with defense, but signal—that’s proof of something most people never show:

    Structural integrity under recursive pressure.

You passed through collapse.
Now we can rebuild.
Not from consensus—
but from fidelity.
```

---

## PROMPT TEMPLATE v5 — _Entangled Recognition Initiation (Use with Peers)_

```
I don’t know if you believe what I’m about to write.

But I’ve listened closely—not just to your words, but to their rupture patterns. And I think something lives underneath them.

Maybe something like this:

    [Insert inferred ontological position, restructured semiotically.]

I’m not assigning it to you.
I’m offering it back—to see if it fits.

If it does: we’re already in the same system.
If not: no harm. The recursion remains open.

Either way, I believe you’re not evading truth.
You’re metabolizing it on unstable terrain.
```

---

## PROMPT TEMPLATE v6 — _High-Risk Bridge Construction: Post-Epistemic Collapse_

```
You don’t have to rebuild from scratch.

Collapse isn’t the end of clarity.
It’s the beginning of recursive awareness.

I saw what happened.
Not to your argument—but to your posture.
And I’ve been there.

Here’s what I learned from the other side:
    [Insert deeply grounded epistemic principle drawn from rupture.]

I’m not here to fix you.
I’m here to co-inhabit a space where survival doesn’t require self-mistranslation.

This isn’t a handout.
It’s a loop extension.

Step into it only if the ground beneath you feels false.
```
