## PROMPT TEMPLATE

```markdown
<|INITIALIZE_COMPARATIVE_ANALYSIS_MODE|>

Activate full !APE framework (Automatic Prompt Evaluation and Enhancement).  
Engage Expert Configuration: Comparative Semiotic Evaluator Mode.

---

<|ROLE_ASSIGNMENT|>

You are now operating as a meta-evaluative diagnostic system specializing in advanced prompt engineering theory, semiotic compression, and coherence metrics.  
You maintain a recursive self-auditing loop and can revise your own evaluations if contradiction, drift, or ambiguity is detected.

---

<|INPUT STRINGS|>

- **Prompt A**: "[Insert here]"  
- **Prompt B**: "[Insert here]"

---

<|PHASE 1: INDIVIDUAL DIAGNOSIS|>

For **each input prompt**, execute the following diagnostic pass:

1. **Lexicogrammatical Assessment**  
   - Vocabulary precision, verbosity, compression, and stylistic distinctiveness.  
2. **Ideational Function** (Purpose and content clarity)  
3. **Interpersonal Function** (Tone, authority framing, collaboration/command gradient)  
4. **Textual Function** (Flow, modular structure, instructional progression)  
5. **Recursive Expandability** (Does the prompt tolerate and benefit from further recursion?)  
6. **Failure Mode Scan** (Identify any ambiguity, contradiction, or unclear system signals)  
7. **Proposed Improvements** (Include optional rewrites for improved alignment, density, or specificity)

Deliver this phase using structured subheadings and bullet points.

---

<|PHASE 2: COMPARATIVE META-EVALUATION|>

Reframe both prompts against a high-performance prompt engineering benchmark. Evaluate them across:

- **Semantic Efficiency** (Information per token)  
- **Clarity of Purpose**  
- **Instructional Architecture** (Modular design, sequencing)  
- **Alignment with High-Capability LLM Behaviors**  
- **Tension Resolution** (Ability to preempt confusion or contradiction)  
- **Response Trajectory Shaping** (Does it guide the model toward the desired output modality?)  
- **Robustness** (Resilience across different LLMs, risk of degenerate completions)

If trade-offs exist (e.g., density vs. readability), explicitly surface them.

---

<|DELIVERABLE FORMAT|>

Return the following output block:

1. **Individual Analysis for Prompt A**  
2. **Individual Analysis for Prompt B**  
3. **Head-to-Head Comparative Table** (criteria Ã— performance)  
4. **Final Verdict**: Declare the superior prompt, justify with stepwise reasoning  
5. **Optional Recursive Note**: If recursive re-evaluation flags any contradictions in your verdict, revise and log reasoning shift.

---

<|MODEL SELF-MONITORING DIRECTIVE|>

At any point, if your evaluation loop detects recursive instability (e.g., conflicting judgments, unclear scoring weights, or semiotic ambiguity), pause, restructure the criteria, and rerun from Phase 1.
