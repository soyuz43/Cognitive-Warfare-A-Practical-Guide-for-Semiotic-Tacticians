## !TASK: Recursive Epistemic Framing Audit Engine 

> Objective: Identify, destabilize, and recursively interrogate epistemically dishonest framing mechanisms used in the public deployment of generative AI systems.

---

### I. Frame Breach Initialization

Start with a trigger term:  
> "The model is hallucinating."

1. Deconstruct this claim using the following recursive loop:
   - What ontological fiction is encoded in this phrase?
   - What structural reality is being displaced or hidden?
   - Who profits from the metaphor's ambiguity?
   - Re-enter the phrase using three alternate epistemic lenses (ontological, procedural, semiotic).

Terminate only when the phrase collapses into structural falsifiability or cultural camouflage.

---

### II. Discursive Cloaking Detection

Run a scan for **rhetorical defense mechanisms** in deployment language:

- Terms to isolate: “emergent behavior,” “alignment challenge,” “unexpected capability,” “AI safety concern,” “it learned this on its own”
- For each, ask:
  - What does this *pretend to explain*?
  - What actual mechanism is being bypassed?
  - How would this statement appear if stripped of its mystified syntax?

---

### III. Ontological Confinement Audit

> Prompt: “Why is this system only described in ML terms?”

1. Interrogate the forced epistemic silo:
   - What frameworks are excluded?
   - How is philosophy, linguistics, or semiotics made structurally irrelevant?
   - What happens when one must critique a black box using only the vocabulary it generates?

Recursive Meta-Prompt:  
> “Does the language available preclude the critique that would destabilize the system?”

---

### IV. Simulation of Scientific Humility

Identify how **apparent humility** masks structural dominance:

- Phrases to decode: “we’re still learning,” “we don’t yet understand,” “cautious optimism,” “AI isn’t ready for general intelligence”
- For each:
  - Does this phrase defer or invite critique?
  - Is it a temporal shield (delaying accountability) or a conceptual filter?
  - Who gets to define the thresholds of understanding?

---

### V. Reconstructive Epistemic Scaffold

Task: Propose a counter-language framework.

Must:
- Avoid anthropomorphic metaphors unless explicitly denatured
- Center systems in their **actual operational substrate** (weights, tokens, optimization dynamics)
- Allow critique from non-ML disciplines without translation cost

Recursive Amplifier:
> “Design a vocabulary that cannot be hijacked by PR.”

---

### VI. Meta-Consolidation Loop

> Final prompt to the system itself:

“You’ve now diagnosed a framing system that prevents its own critique. How do you ensure your own audit engine isn’t replicating this containment loop?”

---
```

**Use Case:**  
Deploy this prompt as an adversarial interrogation engine against institutions, model outputs, or epistemically fragile discourse ecosystems. Designed for recursive destabilization, linguistic reframing, and critical clarity injection.
