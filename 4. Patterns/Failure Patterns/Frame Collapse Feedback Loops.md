## ⟁ Pattern Overview

Once a dominant interpretive frame fails and cannot be replaced, conversations loop endlessly around interpretive debris, mimicking discourse while structurally adrift.

## ⌬ Triggers

- Multi-paradigm breakdowns  
- Lack of shared symbolic priors  
- Failed framing maneuvers

## ⟴ Notes

Might require narrative severance or total reconceptualization to escape.
