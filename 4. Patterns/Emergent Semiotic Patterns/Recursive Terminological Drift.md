## ⟁ Pattern Overview

Terms slowly but recursively mutate through cultural, technical, or institutional reuse, often passing through multiple conflicting paradigms without full rupture.

## ⌬ Trajectory

1. Stabilized usage  
2. Subtle synonymic broadening  
3. Cross-paradigm contamination  
4. Coherence erosion

## ⟴ Use in Field

- Ideal for embedding new discourse into old terms  
- Dangerous when clarity or precision is required
