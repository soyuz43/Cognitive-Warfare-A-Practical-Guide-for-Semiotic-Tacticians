# Pattern Taxonomy Index

This document serves as a living index of semiotic pattern archetypes encountered in cognitive operations. Each pattern is classified by functional domain and interpretive behavior. Use this index for fast deployment, comparative analysis, or recursive modeling.

## ⟁ Pattern Classes

- **Emergent Semiotic Patterns**  
  Patterns that arise spontaneously through symbolic convergence, cultural drift, or structural feedback loops. These are not invented but discovered through attentive observation.

- **Failure Patterns**  
  Patterns describing unintended breakdowns, self-defeating loops, or weapon misfires in symbolic or epistemic maneuvering. Often triggered when systems over-adapt or resist modulation.
