# TERRAIN OVERVIEW

⟁ **Operational Cartography for Semiotic Tacticians**

This file serves as your navigational spine. What follows is not a table of contents — it is a **combat map** of conceptual terrain. Use it to orient, disorient, and recursively re-enter.

---

## 🜁 CORE VORTEX — [[README]]
The incantation. The first fracture. This is where destabilization begins. Contains [[01.0 Operator Ethos]] — your ethical firmware.

---

## 🜁 WEAPONS SYSTEMS — `0. Weapons/`
**Black Weapons**: Cognitive WMDs. Designed to rupture structural consensus.

**Regular Weapons**: Tools for agile disruption. Recursive, modular, memetic.

**Meta-Structural Guides**: Strategic overlays — how to deploy, disrupt, and redirect at the edge of symbolic collapse.

---

## 🜁 DOCTRINAL AXIOMATICS — `1. Fundamentals/`
**Core Doctrines**: Foundational beliefs, not negotiable. Start with [[Foundational Axioms — Living Protocol]].

**Fieldcraft**: Tactical protocols, deployment grammars, rupture vectors.

**Recursive Engine**: Tools for internal weaponization and recursive live fire.

**Repair Protocol**: Not mercy — strategic recovery. Dialectic re-entry and cognitive re-coherence.

---

## 🜁 OPERATIONAL TACTICS — `2. Tactics/`
**Field Tactics**: Deployment blueprints (e.g., [[Lateral Fracture Maneuver]], [[Metaphysical Disarmament Maneuver]])

**Repair Tactics**: Re-alignment strategies post-rupture.

---

## 🜁 SEMIOTIC EXECUTION MODULES — `6. Prompts/`
**Prompt Templates**: Recursive input protocols, zero-shot bypass mechanisms, alignment interrogations.

**Output Examples**: Ground truth traces for high-fidelity testing.

**Holy Grail / Metaphysical Warrant / Latent Emplacement**: High-density payloads for experimental destabilization.

## 🜁 ONGOING OPERATIONALIZATION
This vault is **not a library**.  
It is a weapons cache.  
It will **reconfigure itself** the moment you understand it.

Update this map after significant recursion events.
