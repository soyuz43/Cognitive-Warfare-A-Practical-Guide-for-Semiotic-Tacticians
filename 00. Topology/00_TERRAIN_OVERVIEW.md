## üúÅ Evasion Techniques ‚Äî `3. Evasion Techniques/`

**Evasion Suite**: Defensive epistemic maneuvers designed to sustain system coherence under rupture threat. These are not passive absences ‚Äî they are *active suppressions*. Each technique is a live operation against ontological destabilization, often cloaked in institutional language, polite deflection, or technical authority.

These files expose the operational signatures of *semiotic immunosuppression*. Useful for reverse-engineering propaganda fields, detecting latent frame defense, or stress-testing ideological enclosures.

## üúÅ Patterns ‚Äî `4. Patterns/`

**Semiotic Pattern Recognition**:  
Field-encoded phenomena that recur across rupture deployments, institutional feedback loops, and cultural drift vectors. This directory is not diagnostic ‚Äî it is _symptomatic_. Each entry captures a recognizable structure in the wild. Patterns are divided into emergent weaponizations and failure modes.

### Emergent Semiotic Patterns

Subtle but powerful operational dynamics that often masquerade as organic meaning drift or technical redefinition.

- [[Advertising and Consent Theater]] ‚Äî Simulated agency rituals masking coercive continuity
- [[Cultural Drift Weaponization]] ‚Äî Using cultural lag to embed recursive payloads
- [[Ideological Subduction Cascades]] ‚Äî Collapse and reabsorption of ideological strata
- [[Recursive Terminological Drift]] ‚Äî Slow mutation of terms across paradigms, eroding coherence
- [[Symbolic Scar Tissue Accumulation]] ‚Äî Layered trauma residue from historical semiotic rupture
- [[Weaponized Interpretive Fatigue]] ‚Äî Forcing interpretive exhaustion through saturation, ambiguity, or symbolic overload

### Failure Patterns

Systemic collapse modes, often triggered by rupture mishandling or defensive overcorrection. Useful for backtracing epistemic entrenchment or ideological breakdown.

- [[Boundary Defense ImmunoResponse]] ‚Äî Systemic rejection of perceived ontological threat
- [[Epistemic Hardening Rebound]] ‚Äî Overcorrection that results in rigidity and dogmatism
- [[Frame Collapse Feedback Loops]] ‚Äî Self-reinforcing semantic breakdown under sustained contradiction

## üúÅ Ongoing Operationalization
This vault is **not a library**.  
It is a weapons cache.  
It will **reconfigure itself** the moment you understand it.

Update this map after significant recursion events.
