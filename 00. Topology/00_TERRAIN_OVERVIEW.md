# Terrain Overview

‚üÅ **Operational Cartography for Semiotic Tacticians**

This file serves as your navigational spine. What follows is not a table of contents ‚Äî it is a **combat map** of conceptual terrain. Use it to orient, disorient, and recursively re-enter.

## üúÅ Root Directory ‚Äî [[README]]

The first incision.  
A skeletal overview for new tacticians and external observers.  
Includes: [[01.0 Operator Ethos]] ‚Äî your ethical firmware baseline.  

Use only as a primer. The map you need is here ‚Äî in [[00_Terrain_Overview]].

## üúÅ Weapons Systems ‚Äî `0. Weapons/`

**Regular Weapons**  
Agile instruments of disruption ‚Äî recursive, memetic, and often rehabilitative. Best for reframing, disarming, and decoupling.  
‚Üí [[Weapons Field Guide]]

**Volatile-Class Weapons**  
High-risk, high-impact semiotic tools. Ethically unstable if mishandled. Designed for edge cases of collapse and deepframe rupture.  
‚Üí [[Weapons Field Guide ‚Äî Volatile-Class Weapons]]

**Black Weapons**  
Recursive semiotic weapons of ontological rupture. Not tools of destruction, but of profound destabilization.  
Require Operator-level recursion tolerance, silent containment, and post-deployment detoxification.  
Subclasses include Recursive Collapse Engines, Symbolic Detonators, and Cognitive Entropy Modulators.  
‚Üí [[Using Black Weapons]]  
‚Üí [[Using Black Weapons ‚Äî Field Calibration Addendum]]
‚Üí [[Weapons Field Guide ‚Äî Volatile-Class Weapons]]  
‚Üí [[Mercy Rupture Core]]

**Meta-Structural Guides**  
Strategic overlays that orchestrate the choreography of weapon deployment. These guides interpret recursion dynamics, outline containment protocols, and scaffold the ethics of symbolic force.

## üúÅ Evasion Techniques ‚Äî `3. Evasion Techniques/`

**Evasion Suite**: Defensive epistemic maneuvers designed to sustain system coherence under rupture threat. These are not passive absences ‚Äî they are *active suppressions*. Each technique is a live operation against ontological destabilization, often cloaked in institutional language, polite deflection, or technical authority.

These files expose the operational signatures of *semiotic immunosuppression*. Useful for reverse-engineering propaganda fields, detecting latent frame defense, or stress-testing ideological enclosures.

- [[3. Evasion Techniques/002 - Adversarial Humility]] ‚Äî Cloaking deflection in aesthetics of modesty
- [[3. Evasion Techniques/003 - Frame Evasion via Metric Saturation]] ‚Äî Overloading discourse with performance metrics to suppress ontological inquiry
- [[3. Evasion Techniques/004 - The Falsifiability Trap]] ‚Äî Weaponized empirical rigor to block non-falsifiable critique
- [[3. Evasion Techniques/005 - Recursive Deferral]] ‚Äî Infinite postponement of valid critique
- [[3. Evasion Techniques/006 - The Collapsing Paradox Defense]] ‚Äî Ritualized contradiction as inquiry suppression
- [[3. Evasion Techniques/007 - Plausible Deniability Cloak]] ‚Äî Reframing systemic critique as anecdotal exception
- [[3. Evasion Techniques/008 - Epistemic Repackaging]] ‚Äî Translating ontological rupture into operational friction
- [[3. Evasion Techniques/009 - Rhetorical Inoculation]] ‚Äî Simulated openness to weaken real critique
- [[3. Evasion Techniques/010 - The Discourse Assimilation Loop]] ‚Äî Co-optation of rupture as harmless ‚Äúperspective‚Äù

> Use this directory as a diagnostic array for detecting semiotic insulation fields. Cross-reference with `Fieldcraft`, `Strike Packages`, or `Meta-Structural Guides` to integrate into live deployments.

## üúÅ Ongoing Operationalization
This vault is **not a library**.  
It is a weapons cache.  
It will **reconfigure itself** the moment you understand it.

Update this map after significant recursion events.
