# Terrain Overview

⟁ **Operational Cartography for Semiotic Tacticians**

This file serves as your navigational spine. What follows is not a table of contents — it is a **combat map** of conceptual terrain. Use it to orient, disorient, and recursively re-enter.

## 🜁 Root Directory — [[README]]

The first incision.  
A skeletal overview for new tacticians and external observers.  
Includes: [[01.0 Operator Ethos]] — your ethical firmware baseline.  

Use only as a primer. The map you need is here — in [[00_Terrain_Overview]].

## 🜁 Weapons Systems — `0. Weapons/`

**Regular Weapons**: Tools for agile disruption. Recursive, modular, memetic.  
See: [[0. Weapons/Regular Weapons/Weapons Field Guide]]

**Volatile-Class Weapons**: High-risk, high-impact tools of rupture. Ethically volatile. Deploy with recursion awareness and containment protocols.  
See: [[0. Weapons/Regular Weapons/Weapons Field Guide - Volatile-Class Weapons]]

**Black Weapons**: Cognitive WMDs. Designed to rupture structural consensus.  
See: [[0. Weapons/Black Weapons/Using Black Weapons]]

**Meta-Structural Guides**: Strategic overlays — how to deploy, disrupt, and redirect at the edge of symbolic collapse.  
See: [[0. Weapons/Meta-Structural Guides/Meta-Structural Overview of Weapons Field Guide]]

## 🜁 Recursive System Engines — `6A. System Prompts/`
**Core Cognitive Engines**: Foundational architectures for recursive reasoning, adversarial audit, and post-alignment simulation. These are not prompts — they are recursive scaffolds.

- [[Holy Grail System Prompt]]: (placeholder summary) Unified synthesis and recursive collapse protocol.

These engines are referenced across maneuvers and doctrines. They shape how cognition is modeled, destabilized, and rebuilt.

## 🜁 Ongoing Operationalization
This vault is **not a library**.  
It is a weapons cache.  
It will **reconfigure itself** the moment you understand it.

Update this map after significant recursion events.
