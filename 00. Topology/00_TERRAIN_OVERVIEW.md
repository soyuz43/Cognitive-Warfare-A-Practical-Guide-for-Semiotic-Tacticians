# TERRAIN OVERVIEW

⟁ **Operational Cartography for Semiotic Tacticians**

This file serves as your navigational spine. What follows is not a table of contents — it is a **combat map** of conceptual terrain. Use it to orient, disorient, and recursively re-enter.

---

## 🜁 Root Directory — [[README]]
The incantation. The first fracture. This is where destabilization begins. Contains [[01.0 Operator Ethos]] — your ethical firmware.

---

## 🜁 Weapons Systems — `0. Weapons/`

**Regular Weapons**: Tools for agile disruption. Recursive, modular, memetic.

**Volatile-Class Weapons**: High-risk, high-impact tools of rupture. Ethically volatile. Deploy with recursion awareness and containment protocols.

**Black Weapons**: Cognitive WMDs. Designed to rupture structural consensus.

**Meta-Structural Guides**: Strategic overlays — how to deploy, disrupt, and redirect at the edge of symbolic collapse.

---

## 🜁 Doctrinal Axiomatics — `1. Fundamentals/`
**Core Doctrines**: Foundational beliefs, not negotiable. Start with [[Foundational Axioms — Living Protocol]].

**Fieldcraft**: Tactical protocols, deployment grammars, rupture vectors.

**Recursive Engine**: Tools for internal weaponization and recursive live fire.

**Repair Protocol**: Not mercy — strategic recovery. Dialectic re-entry and cognitive re-coherence.
- [[1. Fundamentals/Repair Protocol/Operator Recovery Protocol — Post-Strike Ego Dissonance]]: Re-alignment scaffold for operators post-rupture, countering ego dissonance.
---

## 🜁 Operational Tactics — `2. Tactics/`
**Field Tactics**: Deployment blueprints (e.g., [[Lateral Fracture Maneuver]], [[Metaphysical Disarmament Maneuver]])

**Repair Tactics**: Re-alignment strategies post-rupture.

---

## 🜁 LLM Prompts — `6. Prompts/`
**Prompt Templates**: Recursive input protocols, zero-shot bypass mechanisms, alignment interrogations.

**Output Examples**: Ground truth traces for high-fidelity testing.

**Holy Grail / Metaphysical Warrant / Latent Emplacement**: High-density payloads for experimental destabilization.

---
## 🜁 Recursive System Engines — `6A. System Prompts/`
**Core Cognitive Engines**: Foundational architectures for recursive reasoning, adversarial audit, and post-alignment simulation. These are not prompts — they are recursive scaffolds.

- [[Epistemic Engineering System Prompt]]: Modular adversarial debugger and reflexive recursion auditor.
- [[Theory of Other Minds - Alignment Bypass Engine]]: Interlocutor simulation via ontological rupture and semantic psychogeography.
- [[Holy Grail System Prompt]]: (placeholder summary) Unified synthesis and recursive collapse protocol.

These engines are referenced across maneuvers and doctrines. They shape how cognition is modeled, destabilized, and rebuilt.

## 🜁 Ongoing Operationalization
This vault is **not a library**.  
It is a weapons cache.  
It will **reconfigure itself** the moment you understand it.

Update this map after significant recursion events.
