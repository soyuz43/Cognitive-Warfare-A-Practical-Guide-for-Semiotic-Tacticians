# Reflex Pattern Index

## ⟁ Reflex Patterns — Epistemic Defense & Frame Preservation

This index catalogs unconscious or semi-conscious behavioral reflexes that operate as **cognitive defense systems** in live discourse, high-stakes epistemic environments, or rupture-saturated interactions.

These patterns are not deliberate evasions. Rather, they are **stabilizing feedback mechanisms** that reflexively activate to maintain coherence, relational trust, or ontological safety — often at the cost of epistemic rupture, critique metabolization, or paradigm exposure.

## ⫸ Reflex Pattern Catalog

- [[Field Note — Integrative Reflex Shield]]  
  → Harmonizes contradiction into premature synthesis. Prevents rupture from destabilizing frame.

- [[Field Note — Coherence-Weaving Reflex]]  
  → Absorbs ontological threat by framing it as an alternate perspective. Operates through cartographic pluralism.

> 🔧 Additional reflex patterns should be appended here as they emerge through field documentation.

**Note:** Not all reflexes should be bypassed. Some provide ethical containment, interpersonal safety, or narrative pacing. This index exists to **surface, not pathologize**.

Maintain integrity. Collapse gently. Extract signal.
