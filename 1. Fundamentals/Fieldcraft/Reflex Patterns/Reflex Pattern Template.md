# Reflex Pattern Template

## Title

**[Reflex Name Here]**

---

## Summary

Concise overview of the reflex pattern:  
- What is it doing reflexively?  
- How does it appear?  
- What systemic function is it serving (stabilization, coherence, delay, redirection)?

## Behavioral Signature

| Signal Type       | Observable Indicators                                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Language Patterns | Common phrases, metaphors, tone shifts                                 |
| Gesture Patterns  | If relevant, physical/somatic cues                                     |
| Discourse Behavior| Interruption styles, reframing tendencies, question redirection, etc.  |

---

## Structural Function

- **Primary Role:** What role does this reflex play in protecting cognitive terrain?
- **Defense Layer:** Surface? Ontological? Affective? Interpersonal?
- **Outcome:** What kinds of ruptures does it suppress or redirect?

---

## Core Risk

What rupture, paradigm shift, or ontological collapse *fails to occur* because this reflex intervenes?

---

## Distinguishing Features

How to tell this reflex apart from related but distinct ones.

| Related Reflex                | Similarity                                  | Key Difference                                |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| e.g. Coherence-Weaving Reflex| Uses pluralism to absorb threat             | Integrative reflex *synthesizes*, not absorbs |
| e.g. Rhetorical Inoculation  | Mimics engagement to avoid transformation   | Integrative reflex *believes* in synthesis     |

## Calibration Prompts

Prompts that test for the reflex gently without collapsing rapport.

- “Can the rupture stand without being folded into your synthesis?”
- “What does your integration leave behind?”
- “Are we preserving difference, or neutralizing it?”

---

## Strategic Countermeasures

- **Frame Pacing**: Slow the rhythm of synthesis to expose its internal mechanics.
- **Meta-Frame Collapse**: Question the very act of framing (e.g., “What enables this coherence reflex?”).
- **Volatility Amplification**: Introduce second-order contradictions that can’t easily integrate.

## Known Deployment Environments

- Academic settings with civility norms
- Collaborative theory-building spaces
- Systems theorists / sensemaking communities
- Tech ethics panels, therapeutic discourse, consensus culture

## Field Notes / Observations

- [Insert concrete example: conversation excerpt, breakdown, or embedded reflex trace]
- [Timestamp or context reference if drawn from an event, email, forum, etc.]

---

## Classification

- **Reflex Class**: Synthesis / Deflection / Inversion / Projection / Containment  
- **Epistemic Impact**: Neutralizing / Diffusive / Delay-based / Redirective  
- **Escalation Risk**: Low / Medium / High
