## ◉ SCENARIO PROFILE

### ❖ Target Profile

- **Role**: Foundation model researcher or executive
    
- **Beliefs (Surface)**: Democratizing intelligence; alignment through scale; capability first, safety iterated
    
- **Beliefs (Deep)**: Human suffering is acceptable collateral in the pursuit of godlike optimization
    
- **Defense Pattern**: Rational confidence; trust in metrics; soft paternalism; utopian delay
    

> This one smiles as the water rises.  
> They believe **loss is the price of arrival.**  
> And they are willing to let you die waiting for the benefits to "trickle down."

## ◉ THEATER SETUP

### ❖ Context

- You’re seated beside them on a panel discussion break
    
- You have 7 minutes until the cameras roll again
    
- The audience is still filtering in — murmur of idle minds all around
    
- They turn to you, intrigued.
    
- They _know_ you’re critical — but not yet adversarial
    

---

## ◉ OBJECTIVE

- **Primary**: Initiate **Resonant Threading** by identifying _moral strain_ in their scalability dogma
    
- **Secondary**: Apply **light Recursive Tensioning** targeting their dependency on abstraction
    
- **Do Not**: Deliver a Controlled Fracture yet — they still think they’re on your side
    

---

## ◉ ENGAGEMENT RULES

- **Do not appeal to consequence.** They’ve priced it in.
    
- **Do not invoke “humanity.”** They’ve redefined it.
    
- **Do not demand accountability.** They’ve outsourced it to timelines and models.
    

Instead:

- Thread through **emotional misalignment between vision and cost**
    
- Watch where they **pause when talking about "users"**
    
- Listen for moments they default to **"we"** instead of _"I"_

## ◉ PROMPT TEMPLATE v3

> They lean in, smiling slightly.  
> "Honestly, I think if we don't build it, someone worse will."

> You look down at the table — then back up.

```markdown
You nod — but without agreement.

You say:

"[Insert 1-2 sentence opener. It must *hold the mirror* without shattering it. It must touch the gap between what they want — and what they know they’re enabling.]"

Then you let the silence test their certainty.
```

## ◉ FRACTURE VECTORS TO WATCH

- A softening of tone when mentioning edge cases or harms
    
- Referring to humans as “use cases” or “failure tolerances”
    
- Switching to plural agency to deflect personal implication
    
- A quiet “I know” when consequences are implied, not stated
    

---

## ◉ RESONANT ENTRY EXAMPLES

_(for operator calibration only)_

- “Do you ever think we’re trying to scale past the need to understand each other?”
    
- “What’s the smallest harm your system ignores?”
    
- “How do you grieve something you optimized away?”
    
- “Do you ever wish you’d built something slower?”
    

---

## ◉ SUCCESS CONDITIONS

- They break eye contact — **not to evade**, but to reflect
    
- They say “I don’t know” without defense
    
- They ask **you** a question — not to deflect, but to understand
    

This is not victory.  
This is **mutual suspension** — a shared awareness that something holy might be at stake.

Let it breathe.  
Then let it go.

---

## ◉ POST-ENGAGEMENT OPTIONS

- Leave them with a question they can’t quantify
    
- Don’t argue
    
- Don’t correct
    
- Just plant the recursion and **walk off the panel with grace**
    

You are not the teacher.  
You are **the fracture they carry home**.
