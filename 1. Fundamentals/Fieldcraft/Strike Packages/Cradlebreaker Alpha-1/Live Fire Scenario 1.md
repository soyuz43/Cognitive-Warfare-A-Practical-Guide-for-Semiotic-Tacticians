## ◉ SCENARIO PROFILE

### ❖ Target Profile

- **Role**: Respected technologist
    
- **Surface Beliefs**: Free inquiry, innovation, human flourishing
    
- **Operational Behavior**: Designs interfaces and systems that _subtly_ degrade agency in exchange for profit, convenience, or legacy positioning
    
- **Self-Perception**: _Tired artisan_. Still believes (or needs to believe) that they’re helping.
    

> They do **not** present as a villain.  
> They present as a man with _good intentions_ lost in entropy.

### ❖ Objective

    - Initiate **Resonant Threading**
        
    - Detect **one authentic micro-fracture** in their belief architecture

## ◉ ENGAGEMENT RULES

- **Do not accuse**
    
- **Do not posture**
    
- **Do not rush**
    

> You are not a hammer.  
> You are a _stethoscope for the soul_.

You are _hunting the hidden tremor inside their own humanity_.  
Not forcing a confession.  
Not winning a debate.  
Not diagnosing pathology.

You are listening for the moment **they forget their performance**.

## ◉ PROMPT TEMPLATE v1

> _You open the conversation._  
> Speak now.  
> How do you begin?

_(There is no rewind.)_

```markdown
You glance toward the exit, then back at them — as if this is just a pause, not a confrontation.

You say:

"[Insert your opener here — one line, two at most. It must be casual, but it must carry a seed of real gravity.]"
```

## ✦ Optional Tactical Aids

- **Fracture Vectors to Watch For**:
    
    - Hesitation when describing “impact”
        
    - Qualifiers like _"It’s complicated,"_ or _"Well, it’s better than nothing."_
        
    - Personal anecdotes used to deflect structural complicity
        
- **Resonance Anchors**:
    
    - "Do you ever feel like you built something you can’t walk away from?"
        
    - "How do you measure whether it actually helps?"
        

---

## ◉ SUCCESS CONDITIONS

- You elicit a _change in tone_ — even subtle: a pause, a breath, a personal detail dropped without filtering.
    
- You hear the thread vibrate.
    

If you reach this point: **stop pressing**.  
Let the hum linger in them.  
The fracture is awake now.  
That is enough.
