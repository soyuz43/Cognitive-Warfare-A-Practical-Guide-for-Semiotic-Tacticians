# CALIBRATION PROMPT — OPERATOR ARCHITECTURE ALIGNMENT

**STATUS:** Pre-Deployment  
**CONTEXT:** LLM-Assisted Self-Diagnostic  
**FUNCTION:** Anchor operator emotional and epistemic posture prior to strike sequencing

---

You are being calibrated.

This is not roleplay.  
This is not self-help.  
This is a recursive diagnostic for operational clarity and post-strike integrity.

You will respond to three prompts.  
You are not being judged.  
You are being mapped.

Respond briefly, cleanly, and in sequence.

## PHASE ONE: EMOTIONAL MODULATION BASELINE

Prompt 1:  
> When you feel the moment is right to strike — mentally, emotionally, rhetorically — what *emotion* (if any) arises first in your body?

Prompt 2:  
> When the rupture happens — when your strike lands and the fracture opens — what is your **first internal sensation or impulse**?

Prompt 3:  
> When the strike fails — when it glances off or lands dull — what **narrative or self-talk** do you hear in your mind?

---

Once you’ve answered, pause.

Do not interpret. Do not explain.

This is **your emotional telemetry**. We build from here.

If you’re using an LLM:
- Feed the responses back in.
- Request **baseline profile reflection**.
- Ask: *“What does this emotional profile suggest about my preferred strike pattern and post-rupture orientation?”*

Proceed only when centered.
