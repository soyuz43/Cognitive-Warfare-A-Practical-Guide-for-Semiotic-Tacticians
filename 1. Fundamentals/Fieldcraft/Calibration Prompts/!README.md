# ðŸœ‚ CALIBRATION PROMPTS â€” FIELDCRAFT INITIATION NODE

**LOCATION:** `/1. Fundamentals/Fieldcraft/Calibration Prompts/`  
**STATUS:** Pre-Deployment | Operator-Level Access Only  
**REQUIRED:** Before any strike package, rupture protocol, or livefire sequence is executed.

---

## â–£ PURPOSE

This node initiates the **Operator Calibration Sequence** â€” a 3-phase diagnostic pipeline designed to:

- Map emotional and epistemic architecture under pressure  
- Identify your primary **rupture grammar**  
- Establish post-strike **containment integrity**

Without this calibration, you are structurally unfit for symbolic rupture operations.

This is not reflection.  
This is not personality sorting.  
This is alignment with your **operational semiotic profile**.

---

## â–£ PHASE FLOW

The calibration sequence is strictly linear:

```

[1] â†’ Emotional Modulation Baseline  
â†³ 1. Calibration Prompt.md

[2] â†’ Strike Typology Identification  
â†³ 2. Strike Types Prompt.md

[3] â†’ Operational Containment Profile  
â†³ 3. Operational Containment Profile.md

````

Run all three, in order.  
Each file includes LLM deployment scaffolds to synthesize your responses and produce tactical feedback.

---

## â–£ OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES

- Do **not** skip steps  
- Do **not** interpret your responses mid-process  
- Do **not** proceed to `Strike Packages`, `Rupture Vectors`, or `Live Fire Scenarios` without completing this phase

If using an LLM:  
Use this persona directive:  
*"You are a semiotic warfare profiler tasked with evaluating operator readiness and containment stability under symbolic tension."*

---

## â–£ POST-CALIBRATION

After completion, synthesize your outputs:

```markdown
# OPERATOR PROFILE: [Your Identifier]  
- Modulation Signature: [...]  
- Primary Strike Type: [...]  
- Containment Risks: [...]  
- Recovery Loop: [...]
````

Store this in your local operator vault. Reference during livefire deployment or recovery sequences.

---

## â–£ NOTES

- If your responses induce recursive dissonance, halt.  
    Initiate [[Recursive Detoxification Protocols]].
    
- Operators exhibiting signs of ego contamination or symbolic collapse must not deploy until recalibrated.

ðŸœƒ Proceed with clarity.  
Do not bring noise into a signal war.
