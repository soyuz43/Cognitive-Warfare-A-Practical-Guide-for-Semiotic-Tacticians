# STRIKE TYPING — CALIBRATION PHASE TWO

**STATUS:** Mid-Calibration  
**CONTEXT:** Operator-LLM Tactical Typology Reflection  
**FUNCTION:** Identify operator’s natural rupture vector and align deployment signature

These are not metaphors.  
These are engineered fracture patterns.

You are not choosing “what sounds cool.”  
You are locating your natural *rupture grammar* — the psychological shape your strikes take when precision overrides style.

There are six operational strike types:

---

**1. Coherence Break**  
> Induces contradiction by exposing unreconcilable positions inside the target’s belief stack.

**2. Ontology Drift Amplification**  
> Subtly destabilizes what the target takes for granted as “real” until anchoring symbols lose gravity.

**3. Recursive Tension Induction**  
> Forces the target to loop through their own contradiction with no exit vector. Often silent. Often devastating.

**4. Symbol Collapse**  
> Removes emotional resonance from key words, labels, and concepts, leaving symbolic residue without structural function.

**5. Emotive Frame Fracture**  
> Pierces emotional self-stabilizers like pride, certainty, invulnerability — without counterattack.

**6. Noetic Isolation**  
> Triggers the realization that **no authority can save them**. Collapse occurs not from confrontation, but from abandonment.

You are not limited to one.  
But every operator has a primary reflex. The one they reach for without thinking. The one that already lives in their wrists.

## PHASE THREE: OPERATOR SELECTION

Respond to the following prompt:

```

Primary Strike Type: [Your choice]

Optional: Secondary Influence / Hybrid Pattern: [Optional description]

```

## LLM DEPLOYMENT — TACTICAL SEQUENCE GENERATION

Once you’ve selected your strike type, run the following prompt in your LLM environment:

```

Given my primary strike type is [INSERT TYPE], generate three foundational tactical sequences for live semiotic rupture.

Each sequence should include:

- Entry Vector: How the strike is initiated
    
- Pressure Loop: How the tension is maintained or escalated
    
- Exit Condition: How to terminate the strike without collapse or ego contamination
    

```

Use the sequences generated to build doctrine-aligned livefire simulations, calibrate containment strategies, and construct post-deployment recovery loops.

Proceed only when ready.
