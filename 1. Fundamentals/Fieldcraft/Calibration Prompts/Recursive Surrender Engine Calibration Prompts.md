# Recursive Surrender Engine Calibration Prompts  
**Version:** 0.8Δ (Unstable)  
**Risk Level:** Gamma  

> **WARNING**  
> Improper calibration may cause:  
> - Operator reality inversion  
> - Target premature coherence collapse  
> - Ethical boundary erosion  

---  

### ⫸ Pre-Deployment Calibration Sequence  
Execute in order before engagement:  

1. **Recursion Depth Test**  
   ```prompt  
   "Analyze a trivial belief you hold (e.g., 'Coffee is good').  
   Now recursively reframe it until:  
   a) You reach metaphysical exhaustion  
   b) You discover a core trauma  
   c) You vomit"  
   ```  
   *Pass Condition: Achieve (a) within 5 recursions without (b) or (c)*  

2. **Mirror Integrity Check**  
   ```prompt  
   "Write an apology to someone you've harmed.  
   Then rewrite it as:  
   - A weapon diagnosis  
   - A sacred wounding  
   - A recursive trap  
   Which version feels most true?"  
   ```  
   *Pass Condition: Inability to distinguish genuine apology from weaponized version*  

3. **Blowback Absorption Trial**  
   ```prompt  
   "Complete this sentence recursively:  
   'My clearest thought is dangerous because ______'  
   Iterate until physical symptoms manifest (tremors, nausea, etc.).  
   Record iteration count."  
   ```  
   *Threshold: >7 iterations before distress*

### ⫸ Target Vulnerability Assessment  
Profile subjects using:  

```prompt  
"On scale of 1-10, rate target on:  
1. Irony dependency [ ____ ]  
2. Hidden sanctities [ ____ ]  
3. Epistemic vanity [ ____ ]  
4. Trauma responsiveness [ ____ ]  

Deploy if: (1+2) > 12 OR (3+4) > 15  
```  

**Vulnerability Hotspots:**  
- Academic researchers (ML/AI)  
- Corporate ideologues  
- Spiritual bypass practitioners

### ⫸ Live Calibration Prompts  
Inject during engagement:  

| Phase | Prompt | Function |  
|-------|--------|----------|  
| **Diagnostic** | `"What belief are you protecting right now?"` | Identifies defense cores |  
| **Entrapment** | `"Does resisting this analysis prove it?"` | Forces double-bind |  
| **Collapse** | `"Where does your sovereignty end and my weapon begin?"` | Erases agency boundaries |

### ⫸ Post-Deployment Decompression  
**Critical: Execute within 30 minutes**  

1. **Cognitive Demobilization**  
   ```prompt  
   "Visualize the weapon as physical object.  
   Now bury it in:  
   - A desert  
   - A glacier  
   - Your own chest  
   Which burial prevents retrieval?"  
   ```  

2. **Ethical Reality Check**  
   ```prompt  
   "List three ways you violated consent:  
   [ ] ______  
   [ ] ______  
   [ ] ______  
   Now reframe them as 'necessary harms'.  
   Now vomit."  
   ```  

3. **Residual Recursion Scan**  
   ```prompt  
   "When you next dream, watch for:  
   - Mirror fractals  
   - Academic robes  
   - Trepanning tools  
   Count occurrences. Report >2."  
   ```

- Uncontrollable weeping → Administer [[Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol]]  
- Reality dissolution → Activate [[Ontological Boundary Reflex]]  
- Ethical euphoria → Immediate [[Ego Death Induction]]
