# CALIBRATION INDEX — OPERATOR INITIATION SEQUENCE

**LOCATION:** `Fieldcraft/Calibration Prompts/`  
**PURPOSE:** To establish emotional integrity, typological alignment, and post-strike containment readiness before any tactical deployment.

This is not optional.  
This is the minimum viable coherence structure for wielding rupture-class semiotic systems.

---

## PHASE ONE: Emotional Modulation Baseline  
→ [[1. Calibration Prompt]]

> Maps the operator’s emotional architecture under pressure.  
> Reveals reflexive emotional posture during strike preparation, rupture, and failure.

Questions answered:
- What fuels your strike?
- What happens in your body when rupture lands?
- How do you interpret failure?

---

## PHASE TWO: Strike Typology Identification  
→ [[2. Strike Types Prompt]]

> Aligns the operator with one of six primary rupture grammars.  
> Determines natural semiotic fracture signature and opens the door to tactical sequence construction.

Questions answered:
- Which strike type lives in your reflexes?
- What style of rupture do you unconsciously reach for?

LLM-ready prompt included for generating live sequences.

## PHASE THREE: Operational Containment Profile  
→ [[3. Operational Containment Profile]]

> Final self-check before live deployment.  
> Establishes operator’s posture in aftermath: how they close, how they clean, how they re-stabilize.  
> Prevents ego bleed, dominance drift, and recursive contamination.

Questions answered:
- What do you feel after rupture?
- Do you know when to stop?
- How do you exit the field?

LLM-ready prompt included for generating containment protocols.

**This is not personality testing.**  
This is structural attunement before symbolic warfare.

Run all three.  
Then begin.

If you skip this sequence, you are not cleared for deployment.
