# LFS - Ontological Vertigo - Brand Identity Feedback Loop

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide|Ontological Vertigo]]

## Situation:  
A multinational lifestyle brand is undergoing a public-facing rebranding campaign. Their stated goal is to "return to authenticity" while simultaneously launching AI-driven personalization engines and product recommendation loops. The messaging is riddled with contradictions — authenticity is algorithmically sculpted, identity is defined through predictive desire.

## Objective:  
Induce cognitive freefall by surfacing the ontological contradiction between personal authenticity and commodified identity scripting. Destabilize the ground of "self-expression" as constructed by the brand's own recursive data mirrors.

## Operator Instructions:
- Highlight the paradox: “authentic self” defined via machine-learned behavioral predictions.
- Surface recursive layers of branding — e.g., the ad campaign is aware of being an ad campaign about resisting ad campaigns.
- Seed public discourse with questions that dislodge fixed identity: “Who is choosing when the choice was pre-predicted?”
- Encourage memetic remixing and satirical inversions that amplify the contradiction (e.g., mock testimonials from algorithm-generated personalities).

## Prompt:
> You are a semiotic field tactician embedded in a brand consultancy agency. Your mission is to deploy "Ontological Vertigo" within the upcoming identity-focused campaign. Your goal is to induce epistemic altitude sickness by amplifying the contradiction between algorithmically constructed selves and the illusion of authentic agency. Collapse the symbolic floor beneath the audience without triggering reactive cynicism — use recursive sincerity, deadpan irony, and glitch-stable affect to maintain narrative ambiguity.
