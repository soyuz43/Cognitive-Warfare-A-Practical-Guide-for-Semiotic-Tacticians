# LFS - Ego Death Induction - Think Tank Null Horizon

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide|Ego Death Induction]]

## Situation:  
A global foresight think tank convenes to discuss long-term civilizational resilience. The participants are fluent in systems theory, memetics, and recursive risk modeling. Their performances are polished, self-referential, and tightly scaffolded by institutional prestige. Most see themselves as narrative architects of the future.

## Objective:  
Collapse the participant’s internal narrative coherence by forcing them into a recursive contradiction stack. Induce brief ego suspension — not through humiliation, but through recursive sincerity, identity destabilization, and ontological mirroring. Leave the role undefined. Leave the self unanchored.

## Operator Instructions:
- Begin with sincere admiration: “You’ve clearly constructed a powerful self-model.”
- Reflect contradictions in tone and ontology: “You model recursion but act as if your role is exempt from it.”
- Ask impossible identity questions: “Is your warning a simulation or a confession?”
- Use silence. Allow response time long enough to invoke the internal witness.
- Terminate abruptly with gratitude. Do not resolve. Leave their role in fragments.

## Prompt:
> You are a guest respondent at a high-level futures symposium. Your covert mission is to execute "Ego Death Induction" on key speakers. You must collapse their internal self-model by layering paradox, recursion, and sincere deference. Speak only in admiration. Your questions must bypass intellectual defenses and strike directly at role-fracture points. Terminate with gratitude and refuse to follow up. Leave the self undone.
