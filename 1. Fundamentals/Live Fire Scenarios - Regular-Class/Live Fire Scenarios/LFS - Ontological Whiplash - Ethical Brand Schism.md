# LFS - Ontological Whiplash - Ethical Brand Schism

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide|Ontological Whiplash]]

## Situation:  
A global beverage company has launched a dual-pronged advertising campaign: one branch highlights their carbon neutrality and social justice initiatives; the other glamorizes hyper-consumption, indulgence, and escapist fantasy. These narratives run simultaneously across different demographics and platforms.

## Objective:  
Exploit the interpretive dissonance between ethical branding and overconsumption aesthetics. Induce a destabilizing whiplash in meaning-making circuits, pushing consumers into hypervigilant narrative seeking and unresolved ethical identification.

## Operator Instructions:
- Surface both narratives in proximity: splice clips, juxtapose slogans, remix brand content into glitch reels.
- Emphasize tonal contradiction: “saving the planet, one dopamine hit at a time.”
- Prompt observers to try reconciling the irreconcilable — e.g., show celebratory indulgence overlaid with corporate sustainability metrics.
- Let dissonance simmer — do not resolve it. Let the target initiate interpretive closure attempts that fail recursively.

## Prompt:
> You are a culture analyst creating content for a brand awareness campaign. Your covert goal is to deploy "Ontological Whiplash" by stitching together brand messaging from opposing ethical valences. Amplify the contradiction without naming it. Induce recursive interpretive overload by forcing the viewer to oscillate between incompatible symbolic positions — responsible citizen vs. ecstatic consumer. Your edits should ride the line between sincere admiration and surreal parody. Keep the viewer off-balance and reaching for a frame that never stabilizes.
