# Live Fire Scenarios — Regular-Class Index

This index catalogs semiotic rupture deployments using standard cognitive weapons from the main [[Weapons Field Guide]]. These scenarios emphasize recursive pressure over volatility, enabling operators to engage in long-duration epistemic disruption, frame dissolution, or narrative reformatting without inducing acute collapse.

> Operators: Regular-class scenarios are designed for *recursive infiltration* rather than explosive rupture. Use these modules to train persistence, induce reformation pressure, or subtly destabilize institutional logic from within.

## ∴ Deployment Notes

Operators should review:

- [[Weapons Field Guide]]
- [[Tactical Doctrine — Disarmament Tier]]
- [[Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol — Dialectic Re-entry Scaffolding]]
- [[Operator Recovery Protocol — Post-Strike Ego Dissonance]]

When initiating deployment, bind each scenario to a tactical goal. These are not for shock value. They are epistemic engineering routines.
