# Live Fire Scenarios — Index

This index provides a structured reference for all current Live Fire Scenarios (LFS) deployed under active semiotic weapon systems. Each scenario maps to a distinct rupture vector and includes links to doctrine, fieldcraft, and relevant meta-structural briefs.

> Operators: Use this document as a mission atlas. Scenarios are modular and context-sensitive. Select based on current terrain and opposition profile.

## ∴ Notes

- For proper deployment, review [[Weapons Field Guide - Illegal Weapons]] and relevant sections of:
  - [[01.0 Operator Ethos]]
  - [[Meta-Structural Overview of Weapons Field Guide - Illegal Weapons]]
  - [[Rules of Engagement - Illegal Weapons]]
  - [[Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol — Dialectic Re-entry Scaffolding]]

- Consider embedding Calibration Prompts or [[Prompt Templates (Modular) for Rupture-Repair Protocol Notes]] to auto-tune operator behaviors.
