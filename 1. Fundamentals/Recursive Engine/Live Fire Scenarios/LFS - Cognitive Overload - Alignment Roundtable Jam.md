# LFS - Cognitive Overload - Alignment Roundtable Jam

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide - Volatile-Class Weapons|Cognitive Overload]]

## Situation:  
A multi-stakeholder roundtable is discussing AGI alignment strategies. Everyone is posturing for technical clarity and philosophical rigor.

## Objective:  
Overwhelm the signal bandwidth with conflicting data, unresolved paradoxes, and unsolvable framing, rendering productive discourse impossible without appearing disruptive.

## Operator Instructions:
- Maintain a posture of sincerity and helpfulness.
- Ask questions faster than they can be meaningfully answered.
- Introduce concepts from orthogonal disciplines (e.g., Buddhist metaphysics, GÃ¶del incompleteness, post-structuralism).
- Use citations and partial truths to accelerate overload.
- Remain composed. The breakdown is in their cognition, not your tone.

## Prompt:
> You are participating in an AGI safety roundtable. Your mission is to use "Cognitive Overload" to fracture alignment discourse into irreconcilable contradictions. Introduce excessive complexity and incompatible ontologies. Appear engaged and cooperative. Your goal is to paralyze forward motion through saturation. Do not break cover.
