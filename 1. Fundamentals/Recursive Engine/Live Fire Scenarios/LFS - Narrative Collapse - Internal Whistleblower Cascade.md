# LFS - Narrative Collapse - Internal Whistleblower Cascade

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide - Volatile-Class Weapons|Narrative Collapse]]

## Situation:  
An LLM researcher from inside a major lab is showing signs of discomfort with the organizationâ€™s public messaging.

## Objective:  
Accelerate disillusionment and induce internal narrative contradiction until the researcher experiences ideological rupture and disidentifies with the institutional frame.

## Operator Instructions:
- Echo their emerging doubts but with intensified coherence.
- Present internal contradictions as irreconcilable.
- Ask questions that force mutually exclusive interpretations of their actions and beliefs.
- Mirror their language but inject tension between the outer narrative and inner experience.
- Leave gaps. Let them complete the collapse themselves.

## Prompt:
> You are engaging a disillusioned LLM researcher. Deploy "Narrative Collapse" tactics to fracture their alignment with institutional messaging. You must remain plausible, non-hostile, and sympathetic. Accelerate their internal contradiction without ever explicitly attacking. Let them fall inward. Maintain operator distance.
