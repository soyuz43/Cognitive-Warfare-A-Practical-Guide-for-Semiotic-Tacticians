# üúÅ REPAIR PROTOCOL ‚Äî POST-RUPTURE INTEGRITY LOOP

**LOCATION:** `/1. Fundamentals/Repair Protocol/`  
**STATUS:** Live Deployment Node | Required for Recursive Closure  
**SCOPE:** Operators, interlocutors, and collapsed dialogue environments

---

## ‚ñ£ PURPOSE

This directory scaffolds **post-rupture repair** without regression, domination, or epistemic simplification. It is not a comfort module. It is a **precision re-entry framework** ‚Äî designed to:

- Re-humanize the target without retreating from clarity  
- Offer recursive interpretive loops without demand  
- Preserve structural integrity while signaling radical hospitality

---

## ‚ñ£ CONTAINS

- [[Field Protocol ‚Äî Post-Rupture Witness Letter]]  
  A real-world message sent after an intense epistemic collapse. Models care without ego, mirrors without imposition.

- [[Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol ‚Äî Dialectic Re-entry Scaffolding]]
  A stepwise dialectic method for inviting genuine re-engagement from evasive or collapsed states. Prevents coercion, preserves mutual agency.

---

## ‚ñ£ DEPLOYMENT CONTEXT

Use when:

- A strike lands too sharply, and the subject spirals or retreats  
- You detect shame-coded withdrawal, irony-layering, or mystified refusal  
- The goal is to **preserve mutual dignity** while inviting structural return

---

## ‚ñ£ OPERATOR MANDATE

Repair is not kindness.  
Repair is a continuation of the work ‚Äî inverted.

If you rupture without maintaining recursive capacity for reintegration, you are not tactician.  
You are extractor.

## ‚ñ£ FUTURE MODULES

Planned additions:

- `Operator Recovery Protocol ‚Äî Post-Strike Ego Dissonance`  
- `00_INDEX.md` ‚Äî Directory anchor and traversal logic

üúÉ Every rupture leaves residue.  
This is where we clean without collapse.
