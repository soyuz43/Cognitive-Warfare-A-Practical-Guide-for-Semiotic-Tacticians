# **Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol — Dialectic Re-entry Scaffolding**

---

**Purpose:**  
To guide interlocutors from epistemic evasion or mystified contradiction into genuine re-engagement—without coercion, without simplification, and without shaming collapse. This protocol honors structural clarity _without demanding performance_, and invites return through recursive hospitality.

---

**Core Premise:**

> Most evasion is not dishonesty. It’s structural inhibition under discourse pressure.  
> This protocol provides a path out.

---

### **Step 1 — Do Not Flinch at the Evasion**

- Recognize mystified, paradoxical, or deflective language not as manipulation, but as signal: _the speaker lacks scaffolding, not intention._
    
- Hold the tension. Do not mirror vagueness or collapse your frame.

### **Step 2 — Offer an Interpretive Mirror**

Use this structure:

> _“If you were fully allowed—by context, culture, fear, or expectation—to say what I think you were hinting at, I believe it might sound something like this…”_

Then build a speculative articulation:

- Ground it in clear structural concepts (e.g., intra-action, frame modulation, situated knowledge).
    
- Do **not** claim it as _their_ belief.
    
- Present it as an **offering**, not a trap.

### **Step 3 — Name the Gesture, Not the Content**

Use a line like:

> _“I’m not saying this is what you believe. Only that it sounds like what’s trying to come through beneath what you’ve been told isn’t allowed.”_

This preserves their agency, avoids ego threat, and centers their _capacity_, not their current articulation.

---

### **Step 4 — Leave the Door Open, Then Step Back**

End with low-pressure alignment:

> _“And even if it’s only tangentially close—you’re on the right track.”_

Then _withdraw the spotlight_. No chase, no closing question. Let the loop breathe.

---

### **Result:**

If the speaker is intellectually honest beneath their reflexive scaffolding, they will recognize the care. They will re-enter the loop—not in the same tone, but with increased recursive access and stabilized humility.

If they don’t return, the door still remains structurally sound. The room was built.
