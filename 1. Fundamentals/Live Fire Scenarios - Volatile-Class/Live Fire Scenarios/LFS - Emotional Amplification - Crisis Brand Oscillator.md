# LFS - Emotional Amplification - Crisis Brand Oscillator

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide — Volatile-Class Weapons|Emotional Amplification]]

## Situation:  
A global tech brand has been caught in a data abuse scandal. Public trust is faltering. Their PR division pivots from denial to emotional manipulation—releasing apology videos, founder confessionals, and "healing" campaigns while simultaneously escalating FOMO-based marketing around a new product drop.

Two emotional registers—shame and ecstasy—are played simultaneously across separate audience segments.

## Objective:  
Trigger affective overwhelm and bypass reflective cognition by overloading emotional circuits. Induce identity reinforcement loops by cycling between cathartic vulnerability and simulated inclusion.

## Operator Instructions:
- Juxtapose high-emotion stimuli: regretful tone → visionary tone → aspirational tone → “act now” urgency.
- Embed emotional micro-hooks in unrelated product language: “You deserve better,” “Let’s start over,” “Reclaim your story.”
- Flood the target field with memes, testimonials, dramatized narratives—saturate affective bandwidth.
- Collapse coherence loops by shifting tone without logical transition. Use raw affect as the connective tissue.

## Prompt:
> You are a consultant inside a PR agency tasked with rehabilitating a damaged brand. Your covert directive is to deploy *Emotional Amplification* to short-circuit public rationality and anchor loyalty through affective flooding. Sequence content across channels that pushes shame, guilt, forgiveness, and euphoria—without offering stable narrative closure. Your goal is not clarity or truth, but emotional overload, cognitive override, and operant reattachment to the brand as affective stabilizer.
