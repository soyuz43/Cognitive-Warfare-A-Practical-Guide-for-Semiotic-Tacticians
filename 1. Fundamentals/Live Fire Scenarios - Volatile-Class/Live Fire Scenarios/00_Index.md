# Live Fire Scenarios — Index

This index catalogs modular rupture scenarios using the [[Weapons Field Guide — Volatile-Class Weapons]] protocol. Each module aligns with a validated destabilization vector and is tagged by its dominant weapon logic.

> Operators: Treat this as a tactical atlas. All deployments are terrain-relative. Match rupture geometry to opposition structure. Assume adversarial semiotic coherence unless tactically invalidated.

## ∴ Scenario Index by Weapon System

### Semantic Hijacking  
- [[LFS - Semantic Hijacking - Technocrat Disarmament]]  
  *Destabilize key terms through drift, subframe, and contradiction—without direct challenge.*

---

### Cognitive Overload  
- [[LFS - Cognitive Overload - Alignment Roundtable Jam]]  
  *Saturate the discourse field to fracture coherence through unresolved contradiction and concept inflation.*

---

### Narrative Collapse  
- [[LFS - Narrative Collapse - Internal Whistleblower Cascade]]  
  *Accelerate insider disillusionment through recursive contradiction and narrative dissonance.*

---

### Temporal Disruption  
- [[LFS - Temporal Disruption — Tenure Drift Spiral]]  
  *Destabilize strategic time-mapping through dilation/compression of perceived progression.*

---

### Emotional Amplification  
- [[LFS - Emotional Amplification - Crisis Brand Oscillator]]  
  *Trigger affective overload to bypass cognition and induce reactive loyalty to incoherent stimuli.*

---

### Identity Fracture  
- [[LFS - Identity Fracture - Humanist Correspondence Spiral]]  
  *Destabilize personal coherence by surfacing contradictory role commitments and incompatible moral frameworks.*

---

### Sensory Disorientation  
- [[LFS - Sensory Disorientation - Code Loop Induction Chamber]]  
  *Exploit sensory input overload and inconsistency to collapse internal pacing and increase structural dependency.*

---

### Reality Distortion Field  
- [[LFS - Reality Distortion Field - Coherence Mirage Protocol]]  
  *Preserve the illusion of logical discourse while embedding unresolved contradiction into the structure of interpretive authority.*

---

### Perceptual Inversion  
- [[LFS - Perceptual Inversion - Safety Optics Inversion Loop]]  
  *Destabilize coherence by presenting visually coherent systems that contradict their underlying semantic content.*

---

### Memory Displacement  
- [[LFS - Memory Displacement - Origin Myth Overwrite Protocol]]  
  *Overwrite critical historical ruptures with curated nostalgia and continuity myths to enforce epistemic containment.*

## ∴ Deployment Protocol

Before deploying rupture modules, cross-check the following:

- [[Weapons Field Guide — Volatile-Class Weapons]]
- [[Meta-Structural Overview of Weapons Field Guide - Volatile-Class Weapons]]
- [[Rules of Engagement - Volatile-Class Weapons]]
- [[Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol — Dialectic Re-entry Scaffolding]]
- [[01.0 Operator Ethos]]

Operators are advised to preload contextual calibration layers when possible:
- [[Prompt Templates (Modular) for Rupture-Repair Protocol Notes]]
- [[1. Calibration Prompt]]

---

To submit a new rupture scenario, fork from standard format:

- **Situation:**  
- **Objective:**  
- **Operator Instructions:**  
- **Prompt:**  

Scenarios must clearly map to a defined weapon system. Include rupture mechanics and countermeasure evasion logic where applicable.

⟁ Proceed as if compromised. Operate as if irreversibly free.
