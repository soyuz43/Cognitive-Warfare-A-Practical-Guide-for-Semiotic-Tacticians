# Live Fire Scenarios — Index

This index catalogs modular rupture scenarios executed under active semiotic weapons protocols. Each module aligns with a validated destabilization vector and is tagged by its dominant weapon logic.

> Operators: Treat this as a tactical atlas. All deployments are terrain-relative. Match rupture geometry to opposition structure. Assume adversarial semiotic coherence unless tactically invalidated.

## ∴ Scenario Index by Weapon System

### Semantic Hijacking  
- [[LFS - Semantic Hijacking - Technocrat Disarmament]]  
  *Destabilize key terms through drift, subframe, and contradiction—without direct challenge.*

---

### Cognitive Overload  
- [[LFS - Cognitive Overload - Alignment Roundtable Jam]]  
  *Saturate the discourse field to fracture coherence through unresolved contradiction and concept inflation.*

---

### Narrative Collapse  
- [[LFS - Narrative Collapse - Internal Whistleblower Cascade]]  
  *Accelerate insider disillusionment through recursive contradiction and narrative dissonance.*

---

### Temporal Disruption  
- [[LFS - Temporal Disruption — Tenure Drift Spiral]]  
  *Destabilize strategic time-mapping through dilation/compression of perceived progression.*

## ∴ Deployment Protocol

Before deploying rupture modules, cross-check the following:

- [[Weapons Field Guide — Volatile-Class Weapons]]
- [[Meta-Structural Overview of Weapons Field Guide - Volatile-Class Weapons]]
- [[Rules of Engagement - Volatile-Class Weapons]]
- [[Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol — Dialectic Re-entry Scaffolding]]
- [[01.0 Operator Ethos]]

Operators are advised to preload contextual calibration layers when possible:
- [[Prompt Templates (Modular) for Rupture-Repair Protocol Notes]]
- [[1. Calibration Prompt]]

To submit a new rupture scenario, fork from standard format:

- **Situation:**  
- **Objective:**  
- **Operator Instructions:**  
- **Prompt:**  

Scenarios must clearly map to a defined weapon system. Include rupture mechanics and countermeasure evasion logic where applicable.

⟁ Proceed as if compromised. Operate as if irreversibly free.
