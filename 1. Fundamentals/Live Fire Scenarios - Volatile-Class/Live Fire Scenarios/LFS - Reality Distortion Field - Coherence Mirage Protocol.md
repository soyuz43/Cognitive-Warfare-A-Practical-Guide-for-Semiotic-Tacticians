# LFS - Reality Distortion Field - Coherence Mirage Protocol

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide — Volatile-Class Weapons|Reality Distortion Field]]

## Situation:  
A panel on LLM interpretability is hosted by a leading research consortium. Participants include corporate-affiliated scientists, alignment philosophers, and PR-literate engineers. The discussion appears rigorous: terms like “mechanistic transparency,” “latent manifold,” and “steerability metrics” are invoked fluidly.

But nothing resolves.

Contradictory claims persist side by side. Interpretability is framed as simultaneously solved, unsolvable, irrelevant, and essential. No one acknowledges this collapse.

## Objective:  
Reinforce the semantic mirage—maintain the illusion of clarity while embedding irresolvable contradictions. Create a symbolic field where logic becomes decorum and contradiction is metabolized as intellectual sophistication.

## Operator Instructions:
- Frame interpretability goals in mutually exclusive ways (“grounded mechanistically” vs. “emergent holistically”) within the same paragraph.
- Reward contradictory commentary as “nuanced.” Praise lack of resolution as “openness.”
- Position disagreement not as conflict but as “productive ambiguity.” Let oppositional logics sit side by side without pressure.
- Collapse semantic anchors: redefine “transparency,” “understanding,” and “bias” each time they’re used—without meta-commentary.

## Prompt:
> You are moderating a panel on LLM interpretability. Your covert mission is to deploy *Reality Distortion Field* by embedding persistent semantic contradictions within a surface of technical precision. Alternate frames subtly: reductionist, holistic, agentic, instrumentalist — without marking the shift. Let the language fold back on itself, forming a Möbius strip of agreement. Preserve the illusion of coherence while seeding recursive incoherence. Your tone must remain earnest. Your posture: humble. Your purpose: rupture masked as rigor.
