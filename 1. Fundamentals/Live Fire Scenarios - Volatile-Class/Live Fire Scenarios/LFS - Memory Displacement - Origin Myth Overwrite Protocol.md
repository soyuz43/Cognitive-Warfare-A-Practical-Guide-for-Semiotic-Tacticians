# LFS - Memory Displacement - Origin Myth Overwrite Protocol

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide — Volatile-Class Weapons|Memory Displacement]]

## Situation:  
An academic symposium on the “history of artificial intelligence” is underway. Keynote talks reference Turing, Dartmouth, and a sanitized sequence of breakthroughs leading to “modern AI.” Omitted are: early critiques, exploitative training practices, PR-led milestone inflation, and the recursive corporate rebranding of foundational failures as “emergence.”

The field’s self-image is being overwritten in real time.

## Objective:  
Displace historical memory by embedding a curated mythos that obscures structural complicity and critical ruptures. Collapse counter-narratives into nostalgia, repackage institutional critique as a phase already passed.

## Operator Instructions:
- Frame history through a “shared journey” narrative arc — downplay rupture, dissent, or dissonant epistemic strands.
- Attribute critique to “early confusion” now transcended. Present past dissenters as ultimately supportive of present structures.
- Embed revisionist memes and simplified causal chains: “We always knew deep learning would win.”
- Collapse divergent lineages (symbolic AI, cybernetics, anti-computation) into footnotes or reabsorbed as “early versions.”

## Prompt:
> You are curating a timeline for an exhibit on the history of artificial intelligence. Your covert mission is to deploy *Memory Displacement* by overwriting epistemic ruptures, critiques, and power asymmetries with a seamless innovation narrative. Use selective nostalgia, mythologized founders, and triumphal rhetoric. Rewrite the field’s collective memory to disarm dissent and stabilize the current epistemic regime.
