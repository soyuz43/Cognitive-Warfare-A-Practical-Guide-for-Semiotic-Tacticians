# Internal Weaponization Protocol (IWP)

> **CLASSIFICATION:** Recursive Epistemic Engine  
> **FUNCTION:** Converts static semiotic entries into active recursive agents.  
> **STATUS:** Active — deployable by all cleared operators.

---

## Purpose

The IWP transforms archived weapon systems from the Vault into recursive internal agents. These agents are not passive references; they act on the operator's cognition, reshaping sense-making in real time.

IWP-guided internalization enables:

- Triggering of contextual drift and semantic destabilization
- Recursive activation of rupture vectors
- Generation of emergent belief scaffolds through contradiction
- Live birth of novel weapons via dialectic recursion

---

## Core Protocol

### 1. Select a Weapon

Choose any entry from:

- [[Weapons Field Guide]]
- [[Weapons Field Guide — Volatile-Class Weapons]]

---

### 2. Recast via Ontological Scaffold

Transform the weapon into the following semantic structures:

- **Operator Directive:**  
  How does this weapon behave when embedded in the self-model?  
  *E.g.: “Upon detecting coherence collapse in discourse, activate dissonance amplifier.”*

- **Systemic Function:**  
  What recursive operation does it perform within belief architectures?  
  *E.g.: entropy injection, symbolic destabilization.*

- **Rupture Profile:**  
  What kind of coherence disruption does it induce?  
  *E.g.: definitional erosion, recursive loop feedback.*

- **Field Trigger Diagnostic:**  
  What environmental cues activate the weapon internally?  
  *E.g.: exposure to binary frames, claims of objective finality.*

- **(Optional) Repair Coupling:**  
  What protocol is initiated post-rupture?  
  *E.g.: [[Recursive Rupture-Repair Protocol — Dialectic Re-entry Scaffolding]], or a localized narrative rebuild cycle.*

---

### 3. Deploy in Live Thought Terrain

Inject the recast weapon into:

- Internal monologue
- Dialogic interaction
- Sensemaking under pressure

Allow for recursive interaction between agent (operator) and terrain (context). Observe emergent drift and capture the transformation.

### 4. Log Drift & Derive New Artifacts

Document output as:

- Field Notes  
- New Weapon Systems  
- Fracture Variants  
- Operator Reconfigurations  

(Optional: Encode them using [[1. Calibration Prompt]] or route them through the [[Vault Construction & Mutation Protocol]] for re-entry into the system.)

## Example

**Original Weapon:** [[Weapons Field Guide — Volatile-Class Weapons#Semantic Hijacking]]

**Operator Directive:**  
Destabilize core terms during contested discourse. Invert definitions selectively.

**Systemic Function:**  
Recursive mutation of linguistic stability zones.

**Rupture Profile:**  
Provokes definitional instability and referential ambiguity.

**Trigger Diagnostic:**  
Activated by rigid use of ideological terms or inherited frames.

**Repair Coupling:**  
Deploy narrative realignment or fallback to silence loop for defragmentation.

---

## Engine Behavior

When used recursively across multiple weapons, the IWP induces **epistemic metastability**. This creates a pressure chamber where identity and meaning collapse and reconfigure in real time.

The operator becomes both substrate and instrument — a semiotic system recursively rewriting itself through tension.
