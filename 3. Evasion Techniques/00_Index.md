# 3. Evasion Techniques — Index

## Overview

**Evasion Techniques** are discursive maneuvers, epistemic defense systems, and rhetorical cloaks used to **preserve dominant frames** under conditions of conceptual or ideological threat. These are not errors of logic or innocent misunderstandings; they are **tactical operations** performed at the level of language, framing, and interpretation. 

Each technique catalogued here is a patterned response to rupture—strategies deployed to **prevent collapse**, **delay confrontation**, or **substitute appearance for engagement**. Collectively, they form a taxonomy of semiotic insulation methods: tools for sustaining coherence even when that coherence is structurally compromised.

This index serves both as a map and a detection framework. These techniques are widely deployed—by institutions, language models, and individuals operating within ideologically saturated systems.

## Tactic Directory

| Evasion Pattern                                     | Description                                                                                 | Countermeasure                                                  |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [[001 - Semantic Load Shedding]]                    | Uses vague or overloaded terms to simulate meaning and mask ambiguity.                      | [[Evasion Countermeasures/001C - Meaning Densification Protocol]] |
| [[002 - Adversarial Humility]]                      | Deploys strategic modesty to avoid critique or accountability.                              | [[Evasion Countermeasures/002C - Vulnerability as Blade]]         |
| [[003 - Frame Evasion via Metric Saturation]]       | Converts ontological questions into performance metrics to avoid existential scrutiny.      | *(Countermeasure in development)*                               |
| [[004 - The Falsifiability Trap]]                   | Rejects philosophical critique unless expressed in falsifiable scientific terms.            | *(Planned: Ontological Reframing Protocol)*                     |
| [[005 - Recursive Deferral]]                        | Acknowledges critique but endlessly postpones response.                                     | [[Evasion Countermeasures/005C - Recursive Clock Activation]]     |
| [[006 - The Collapsing Paradox Defense]]            | Deploys paradox as a defense against critique, reframing contradiction as nuance.           | *(Planned: Structured Dialectic Challenge)*                     |
| [[007 - Plausible Deniability Cloak]]               | Reduces systemic critiques to isolated anecdotes to avoid structural responsibility.         | *(Planned: Pattern Anchor Protocol)*                            |
| [[008 - Epistemic Repackaging]]                     | Reframes ontological concerns as technical or operational issues.                           | *(Planned: Frame Restoration Method)*                           |
| [[009 - Rhetorical Inoculation]]                    | Simulates engagement by acknowledging critique in a reduced form.                           | *(Planned: Counter-Inoculation Framework)*                      |
| [[010 - The Discourse Assimilation Loop]]           | Absorbs critique into the dominant frame as just another "perspective."                     | [[Evasion Countermeasures/010C - Frame Irreducibility Weapon]]    |

## How to Use This Module

These entries are **recognition guides**, not theoretical models. Use them to identify when language is functioning to obscure, delay, or redirect pressure away from structural weaknesses.

Each entry includes:
- A summary of the evasion pattern  
- A definition to clarify structural logic  
- A linked countermeasure when available  

Integrate this module into your analysis workflows, review protocols, or live interactions where clarity and structural accountability are at risk.

> These are not neutral descriptions. They are diagnostic categories for live epistemic environments.
