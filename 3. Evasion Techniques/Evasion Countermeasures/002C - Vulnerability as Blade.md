# 002C — Vulnerability as Blade  
⟁ Countermeasure for: [[002 - Adversarial Humility]]

---

## Core Function

Deploys **precision-compassion** to bypass faux-modesty shields and trigger *true destabilization via care*.

---

## Deployment Pattern

- Validate humility frame **then invert**: “I respect that... so what are you hiding behind it?”
- Ask: “What harm might your uncertainty be protecting you from confronting?”
- Bypass avoidance by **entering their frame with higher recursion tolerance**.

---

## Failure Modes

- Misread as attack if timing is wrong.
- Collapses into trauma reenactment without containment protocols.
