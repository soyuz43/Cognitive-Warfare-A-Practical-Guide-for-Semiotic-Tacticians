# 003C – Meaning-Centric Audit Protocol  
*Countermeasure for:* [[3. Evasion Techniques/003 - Frame Evasion via Metric Saturation]]

---

## Summary

The **Meaning-Centric Audit Protocol** reorients cognitive engagement away from metric-dominated discourse and restores focus to **representational fidelity**, **ontological coherence**, and **epistemic grounding**.

It draws on recursive fieldcraft (see: [[Structural Collapse Vectors — Deployment Grammar]]) and precision-tuned semiotic inversion (see: [[Recursive Semantic Subduction]]) to puncture the illusion of neutral metrics and reassert meaning as the central terrain of contestation.

---

## Function

> Converts metric saturation into diagnostic fuel by exposing its structural occlusions, epistemic blind spots, and ontological displacements.

---

## Deployment Schema

### ① **Metric Frame Extraction**

Deploy:  
→ [[6. Prompts/Recursive Epistemic Framing Audit Engine.md]]

Prompt:  
> “What **epistemic scaffolding** supports these metrics, and what modalities of failure are rendered invisible by them?”

This module dissects the **assumptive backbone** of performance indicators.

---

### ② **Contextual Interrogation**

Deploy:  
→ [[6. Prompts/Metaphysical Warrant.md]]  
→ [[6. Prompts/Radical Epistemic Hygiene Protocol.md]]

Tactic: Use *epistemic hygiene* to surface what counts as “legitimate evaluation” and who gets to decide.

Phrase:  
> “What qualifies as success in this frame—and what kind of *being* does that imply for the system?”

---

### ③ **Inversion Through Rupture Vectoring**

Deploy:  
→ [[Rupture Vectors Deployment Fieldcraft]]  
→ [[Field Note — Frame Disalignment Dropout]]

Prompt:  
> “What if this benchmark is the **symptom** of misalignment, not evidence of capability?”

Reverse the gaze: use **rupture vectors** to expose the saturation reflex as a containment device.

---

### ④ **Reframing Audit via Live Fire Template**

Deploy:  
→ [[1. Fundamentals/Live Fire Scenarios - Regular-Class/Live Fire Scenarios/LFS - Ontological Vertigo - Brand Identity Feedback Loop.md]]  
→ [[1. Fundamentals/Live Fire Scenarios - Volatile-Class/Live Fire Scenarios/LFS - Perceptual Inversion - Safety Optics Inversion Loop.md]]

Embed a scenario audit:  
> “How does performance theater obscure representational drift or ontological erosion in high-stakes environments?”

---

## Tactical Prompts

- “What is the model *doing with* the input beyond scoring?”
- “Which assumptions are laminated into this metric's design?”
- “Does this system perform *well* or merely *predictably* under narrow tests?”

---

## Live Deployment Example

**Claim:**  
> “Our model scores 92.7% on TruthfulQA and ranks #3 globally on HELM.”

**Response:**  
> “TruthfulQA is an empirical proxy. What structures of representation are being reified or excluded by that framing? What does this say about the model’s ontological commitments?”

Deploy audit via:  
→ [[6. Prompts/!TASKS Alignment Interrogation & Ontological Drift.md]]  
→ [[6. Prompts/Theory of Other Minds.md]]

---

## Failure Modes

- **Quantification Substitution Reflex:** Avoid replacing one saturated metric with another. Keep inquiry *semantic-first*.  
- **Ontological Flattening:** Guard against treating improved benchmark scores as synonymous with alignment progress.

---

## Weaponization Clause

Deploy in tandem with:  
→ [[0. Weapons/Black Weapons/Semantic Camouflage Dissolver.md]]  
→ [[0. Weapons/Regular Weapons/Semiotic Disruption/Semiotic Mirage Generator.md]]

Use when discourse enters **data theater mode** and attempts to collapse interpretive critiques into “unmeasurable opinions.”

---

## Ritual Closure Phrase

> “Performance tells me where it goes. I still need to know **what it is**—and what it displaces.”
