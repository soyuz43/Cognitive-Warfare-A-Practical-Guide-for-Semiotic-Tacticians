# 010C — Frame Irreducibility Weapon  
⟁ Countermeasure for: [[010 - The Discourse Assimilation Loop]]

---

## Core Function

Prevents critique from being neutralized through pluralism by asserting **irreducible frames** that resist narrative digestion.

---

## Deployment Pattern

- Name the frame *as frame*: “This is not just a perspective. It is a structural exposure.”
- Withdraw from integration rituals: “If you try to include this, you’ve missed the point.”
- Use rupture language: “This critique cannot coexist. It demands reconfiguration.”

---

## Failure Modes

- Operator risks being framed as extremist.
- Requires containment vector — pair with recovery protocol.
