# 008C — Depth Lock Routine  
⟁ Countermeasure for: [[008 - Epistemic Repackaging]]

---

## Core Function

Prevents **deep critique** from being flattened into surface-level issues. Forces conversations to stay rooted in **ontological or structural terms** rather than being translated into technical, logistical, or usability language.

---

## Deployment Pattern

- **Level-Lock Assertion:** Identify what level the critique originally targeted (e.g. worldview, system assumptions, logic collapse), and hold the conversation at that level.  
- **Translation Intercept:** Spot when a deep issue is being restated as a metrics problem, UI bug, or workflow inefficiency.  
- **Collapse Reinflation:** Re-expand the claim to its original depth, emphasizing what’s being ignored in the reframe.

---

## Live Prompts

> “Are we treating a foundational flaw like a design inconvenience?”  
> “What part of the system would break if we took this critique seriously?”  
> “Did this explanation solve the contradiction, or just relabel it?”

---

## Tactical Notes

- **Reframe Audit:** Every system has layers. Map the critique to its proper layer (ontology → epistemology → implementation). Don't let it be downgraded.  
- **Symptom vs Structure Test:** Ask if the explanation is describing symptoms of the issue or actually addressing the root cause.  
- **Containment Breach Prompt:**  
  > “If this were truly just a UX issue, why would it threaten the system’s coherence?”

---

## Failure Modes

- **False Depth Projection:** Risk of overcomplicating simple issues. Use only when original claim had conceptual weight.  
- **Reflexive Absolutism:** Beware treating all system frictions as ontological flaws. This tool is for defending depth, not inventing it.

## Field Commentary

Epistemic Repackaging is dangerous because it’s so polite. It *looks* like progress, but it’s actually a containment tactic—turning system-wide breakdowns into dashboard tasks. The Depth Lock Routine resists this by refusing translation. When someone converts a philosophical rupture into a backlog item, **don’t escalate—anchor**. Hold the floor. Keep the conversation at the level of the wound.

This isn’t about inflating every issue—it’s about defending the few that actually cut to the bone.
