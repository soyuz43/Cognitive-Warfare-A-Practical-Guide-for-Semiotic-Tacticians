# 005C — Recursive Clock Activation  
⟁ Countermeasure for: [[005 - Recursive Deferral]]

---

## Core Function

Builds a **temporal trap** that demands resolution through rhythmic return and time-bound recursion.

---

## Deployment Pattern

- Introduce self-returning prompts: “We’ll return to this in 5 minutes. Be ready.”
- Time-box the deferral loop with escalating linguistic pressure.
- Install **memory anchors**: “You said X earlier. What changed since then?”

---

## Failure Modes

- Clock collapses if external urgency exceeds internal recursion drive.
- Operator must track time/pressure alignment carefully.
