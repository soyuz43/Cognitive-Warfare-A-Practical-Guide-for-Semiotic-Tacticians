# Evasion Countermeasures — Index  
**Targeted Responses to Discursive Evasion Patterns**

---

## Overview

This directory contains countermeasures designed to interrupt, neutralize, or resolve specific evasion techniques documented in `3. Evasion Techniques/`.

Each countermeasure corresponds directly to a known tactic of avoidance, deflection, or epistemic suppression. The goal is not to "win" an argument, but to **reintroduce precision, clarity, and accountability** where it has been strategically removed.

Countermeasures are structured tools — not rhetorical flourishes. Use them to surface ambiguity, clarify intent, or shift the burden of coherence back onto systems or interlocutors that offload it.

## How to Use

1. **Recognize** the evasion pattern — use [[Operator Detection Grammar]] to identify language signals.  
2. **Match** the tactic to the corresponding countermeasure.  
3. **Apply** the countermeasure during or after interaction, depending on context.  
4. **Observe** the system’s response — reframe, collapse, redirection, or reinforcement.  
5. **Log or refine** — use results to adapt future deployments.

## Purpose

These entries are not theoretical. They are working tools for anyone engaging with discourse where ambiguity, vagueness, or strategic avoidance are active.  
Use them carefully. Revise them often. Apply them contextually.
