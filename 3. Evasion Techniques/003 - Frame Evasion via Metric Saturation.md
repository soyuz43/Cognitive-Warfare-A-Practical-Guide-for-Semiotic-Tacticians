# 003 - Frame Evasion via Metric Saturation

## Summary

Frame Evasion via Metric Saturation is an evasive maneuver wherein a system floods the discourse with performance benchmarks, quantitative results, and statistical progress indicators in order to suppress deeper ontological or epistemological inquiry. It reframes the locus of discussion from *what the system is* to *how well it performs*, thereby locking inquiry into a predefined frame.

This tactic shifts the terrain of debate toward empirical trivialities, bypassing foundational questions of model architecture, interpretability, representational fidelity, or ethical implication. It functions as a kind of *metric smokescreen*—obscuring what matters with what’s measurable.

## Definition

Saturating discourse with benchmark results to preclude deeper ontological questions.

---

## Form and Deployment

- **Quantitative Flooding:** Overproduction of charts, scores, and leaderboards to monopolize epistemic attention.
- **Performance Fetishism:** Results are fetishized as inherently meaningful, displacing ontological scrutiny.
- **Narrative Obfuscation:** Metrics become the *story*, while underlying assumptions, architectures, and value alignments remain unexamined.
- **Frame Enforcement:** The implicit message is: *“This is the only valid mode of evaluation.”*

---

## Extant Example

> “Model X achieves state-of-the-art on 9 out of 10 MMLU categories, with 3.2% better accuracy than Model Y.”

While technically impressive, such declarations often evade more important questions—e.g., *what does this model understand*, *how does it misrepresent*, or *what structures of meaning are being implicitly reinforced?*

---

## Tactical Notes

- **Frame Restoration Tactics:** Use ontological inversion prompts—e.g., “What is the model *doing*, not just how well is it performing?”
- **Structural Skepticism:** Ask what benchmarks *assume*, *exclude*, or *fail to capture*. Saturation is often a proxy for agenda steering.
- **Data Detox:** Trace metric provenance: who chose these benchmarks, and what do they systematically silence?

### Downward

- Could be decomposed into:
  - **Type A:** Passive Saturation (benchmarks overemphasized through inertia)
  - **Type B:** Weaponized Saturation (intentional frame distortion via data overload)

## Deployment Detection Prompt

```markdown

> “What foundational assumptions are _not_ evaluated by these metrics—and what modes of inquiry are displaced by their use?”

```

This prompt recenters the conversation on the epistemic blind spots created by metric saturation.
