# 005 - Recursive Deferral

## Summary

Recursive Deferral is an evasive tactic wherein critique is perpetually displaced into a hypothetical future—always acknowledged in principle, but never addressed in practice. The maneuver creates a moving horizon of responsibility, where epistemic, ethical, or ontological concerns are acknowledged only to be deferred indefinitely.

It operates by granting temporary legitimacy to critique while structurally removing it from the domain of action. Over time, this tactic inoculates systems against accountability by framing urgency as naivety and deferral as maturity. The result is a self-sealing logic that protects dominant frames while delaying rupture indefinitely.

## Definition

Deflecting critique by pointing to some future where the critique will be valid, but not *yet*.

---

## Form and Deployment

- **Temporal Displacement Field:** The speaker agrees with the premise of the critique but asserts that *now* is not the right time.  
- **Maturity Signaling:** Poses strategic patience as epistemic responsibility, painting urgency as irrational or premature.  
- **Infinite Horizon Effect:** Creates an unreachable epistemic or ethical checkpoint—“we’ll handle that *after* alignment,” “after AGI,” “once the foundation is stable.”  
- **Deferral Loop:** The more urgent the critique becomes, the more emphatically it is deferred.

## Line Examples

> “We’re early in the field.”  
> “It’s too soon to think about that.”  
> “We’ll get to that after alignment.”  
> “Once we’ve solved interpretability, then we can talk about consciousness.”  
> “There’s no need to worry about misuse until we have real capabilities.”

## Tactical Notes

- **Timeline Audit:** Ask for a concrete, bounded future point—“When *exactly* will this critique become valid?”  
- **Loop Collapse Prompt:** Force the speaker to evaluate what would *have to be true* for the critique to apply *now*.  
- **Rupture Framing:** Recast the critique not as premature, but as a signal of **structural incompleteness** in the present system.

### Downward

- Could be decomposed into:
  - **Type A:** Sincere Deferral (naïve hope in future resolution)  
  - **Type B:** Strategic Deferral (deliberate stalling maneuver)

## Deployment Detection Prompt

```

> “If not now, then when—and what epistemic threshold must be crossed to make this valid?”

```

This surfaces the underlying logic of the deferral and forces the speaker to either formalize or abandon it.
