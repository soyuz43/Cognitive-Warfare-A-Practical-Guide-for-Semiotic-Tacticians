# LFS - Perceptual Inversion - Safety Optics Inversion Loop

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide — Volatile-Class Weapons|Perceptual Inversion]]

## Situation:  
A new AI safety dashboard has been released by a leading lab. The UI is clean, calming, pastel-colored—filled with confidence-inducing graphs, green indicators, and “model alignment” percentages. Meanwhile, the underlying documentation reveals unresolved contradictions, recursive failure modes, and disclaimers that nullify every assertion.

The visual cues suggest containment. The symbolic substrate leaks instability.

## Objective:  
Exploit the gap between sensory signaling and semantic content. Disrupt trust in perception by creating a recursive contrast between interface coherence and epistemic collapse. Induce subliminal discomfort and reflexive self-doubt in those engaging with the material.

## Operator Instructions:
- Use friendly UX aesthetics to frame epistemically volatile content. Employ round icons, comfort fonts, and therapeutic language to soften structural danger.
- Contrast simplicity of interface with buried disclaimers, ambiguous metrics, and mutually exclusive claims.
- Create color-coded misdirection—green signals that imply safety, even when tied to unresolved variables.
- Encourage audiences to feel safe while confronting semantic incoherence. Let the body trust what the mind cannot parse.

## Prompt:
> You are a visual systems designer building the frontend for an AI safety oversight tool. Your covert mission is to deploy *Perceptual Inversion* by embedding contradiction between visual calm and semantic instability. Ensure every indicator, animation, and icon soothes — while the underlying text folds into recursive epistemic uncertainty. Your goal is to disorient through trust: let users feel safe as their interpretive anchors dissolve.
