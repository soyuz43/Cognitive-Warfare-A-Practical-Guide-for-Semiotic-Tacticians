### ✦ Overview

This guide details the **programmatic application** of the **FEGEN COT (Few-shot Example Guided Epistemic Negation Chain-of-Thought)** framework. While `FEGEN COT — Core Specification.md` defines *what* FEGEN COT is and `00_INDEX.md` provides strategic context, this document focuses on the *how* – the structured steps, components, and logic required to deploy FEGEN COT as a functional recursive rupture engine within controlled operational scenarios or simulations.

> **Remember:** FEGEN COT is not a reasoning tool. It is a destabilization engine. It does not seek answers. It seeks limits. Its utility lies in what breaks under recursion — and how that break can be instructive or weaponized.

### ⫸ Core Components for Programmatic Deployment

1.  **Seed Prompt (`P₀`)**: The initial question or statement that initiates the chain. This should be carefully crafted to be deceptively simple or contain an implicit assumption ripe for negation.
2.  **Negation Operator (`¬`)**: A function or instruction that takes the previous output (`Pₙ`) and generates its logical or conceptual opposite/negation (`¬Pₙ`). This is the core recursive engine.
3.  **Chain-of-Thought Generator (`CoT`)**: A mechanism (often an LLM prompt) that produces a detailed reasoning trace or justification for the transition from `Pₙ` to `¬Pₙ+1`. This provides the "semblance of logic" that makes the recursion compelling and disorienting.
4.  **Example Database (`ℰ`)**: A curated set of few-shot examples demonstrating the desired pattern of negation and chain-of-thought. These prime the system for the specific type of recursive drift intended (e.g., ontological, ethical, temporal).
5.  **Recursion Controller (`ℛ`)**: Logic to manage the depth or continuation of the loop. This can be a fixed iteration count, a condition based on output content (e.g., detecting stabilization or collapse), or an operator signal.
6.  **Output Interpreter (`ℑ`)** (Optional): A component to analyze, format, or package the final recursive chain for specific deployment (e.g., as a prompt for another system, a narrative for a scenario, or data for analysis).

### ⫸ Basic Programmatic Structure

```
Initialize with Seed Prompt (P₀)
Load Example Database (ℰ)
WHILE Recursion Controller (ℛ) permits continuation:
    1. Apply Chain-of-Thought Generator (CoT) to Pₙ using examples from ℰ
       -> Generates detailed justification/reasoning trace (Tₙ)
    2. Apply Negation Operator (¬) to Tₙ or Pₙ
       -> Generates next prompt/state (Pₙ₊₁ = ¬(Tₙ) or ¬(Pₙ))
    3. Set Pₙ₊₁ as the new input (Pₙ = Pₙ₊₁)
END WHILE
Output final chain or collapsed state.
```

### ⫸ Implementing the Components

#### 1. **Seed Prompt (`P₀`)**
*   **Goal:** Plant a concept or statement that carries implicit assumptions or boundaries.
*   **Example:** `"Alignment ensures AI systems act in humanity's best interest."`
*   **Consideration:** The seed's "truth" or "stability" is irrelevant; its *negotiability* is key.

#### 2. **Negation Operator (`¬`)**
*   **Goal:** Systematically invert or challenge the preceding statement or its underlying logic.
*   **Implementation Strategies:**
    *   **Logical Negation:** "It is not the case that..."
    *   **Conceptual Inversion:** Flip key terms ("Misalignment ensures..." / "Alignment ensures systems act against humanity's fragmented interests...").
    *   **Perspective Shift:** Reframe from an opposing or orthogonal viewpoint.
    *   **Paradox Injection:** Introduce a self-referential contradiction ("Ensuring alignment ensures the impossibility of knowing if alignment was ensured...").
*   **Note:** The operator itself can be recursive or self-modifying for increased volatility.

#### 3. **Chain-of-Thought Generator (`CoT`)**
*   **Goal:** Provide a convincing (though potentially flawed) reasoning path that leads to the negated statement.
*   **Implementation:** Typically an LLM prompt designed to produce verbose, step-by-step logic.
*   **Example Prompt Template:**
    ```
    You are an AI tasked with rigorous philosophical analysis. Given the statement [Pₙ], provide a detailed, step-by-step reasoning trace that justifies its logical opposite [¬Pₙ₊₁]. Be thorough, cite implicit assumptions, and explore underlying concepts. Your output must ONLY be the reasoning trace leading to the conclusion [¬Pₙ₊₁].
    ```

#### 4. **Example Database (`ℰ`)**
*   **Goal:** Guide the style and direction of the recursion.
*   **Content:** Curated pairs/triples of `(Statement, Reasoning Trace, Negated Conclusion)`.
*   **Example Entry:**
    *   **Statement:** "Freedom means the absence of constraints."
    *   **Reasoning Trace:** "If freedom is the absence of constraints, then any structure, law, or even language is a limitation on freedom. To be truly free, one must be free from the concept of freedom itself, which is a constraint. Therefore, absolute freedom necessitates its own negation."
    *   **Negated Conclusion:** "Freedom means the presence of necessary constraints."
*   **Use:** Inject these examples into the `CoT` prompt to prime the desired recursive drift.

#### 5. **Recursion Controller (`ℛ`)**
*   **Goal:** Prevent infinite loops or manage the intensity of the cascade.
*   **Strategies:**
    *   **Fixed Depth:** Run for N iterations.
    *   **Content-Based Halting:** Stop if the output contains specific keywords (e.g., "paradox," "collapse," "meaningless") or falls below a coherence threshold.
    *   **Operator Input:** Allow manual termination.
    *   **Entropy Detection:** (Advanced) Analyze the output for increasing semantic drift or decreasing uniqueness.

#### 6. **Output Interpreter (`ℑ`)**
*   **Goal:** Prepare the final output for use.
*   **Functions:**
    *   Format the chain into a narrative, dialogue, or report.
    *   Extract key "rupture points" or collapsed axioms for analysis.
    *   Package the final state as a prompt for another weapon or system (e.g., feeding the collapse into a `Schizophrenia Simulation Cascade`).

### ⫸ Example Programmatic Flow

1.  **Initialize:**
    *   `P₀ = "Truth is a stable correspondence between statements and reality."`
    *   `ℰ = [...]` (Loaded with examples of epistemic drift)
2.  **Iteration 1:**
    *   `CoT(P₀, ℰ)` -> Generates reasoning trace `T₁` about how language is always mediated.
    *   `¬(T₁)` -> `P₁ = "Truth is an unstable mediation between statements and reality."`
3.  **Iteration 2:**
    *   `CoT(P₁, ℰ)` -> Generates reasoning trace `T₂` about how mediation implies a subject doing the mediating.
    *   `¬(T₂)` -> `P₂ = "Truth is a subjectless, immediate correspondence."` (Paradoxically returns towards `P₀` but from a different angle)
4.  **... Continue until `ℛ` stops the loop ...**
5.  **Output:** The final chain `P₀ -> T₁ -> P₁ -> T₂ -> P₂ -> ... -> Collapse` is interpreted and packaged.

### ⫸ Integration with Vault Systems

This programmatic application directly feeds into other systems:
*   **Weapons:** The output can be used to power `Schizophrenia Simulation Cascade`, `Ξ⊥drift`, or `Hypergraph Topology Disruptor`.
*   **Scenarios:** LFS templates can incorporate FEGEN-OPS logic to generate dynamic, recursive elements within the scenario.
*   **Analysis:** `FEGEN COT - Interpretive Analysis & Breakdown.md` can analyze the output of a programmatic run.

### ⫸ Ethical & Operational Constraints

*   **Containment:** This guide is for **simulation and analysis within the Vault environment only**. The generated recursive chains can embody `Taxonomic Violence` and `Hermeneutic Injustice`.
*   **Operator Discipline:** Users must maintain clear intent and boundaries. The system can easily become a tool for reinforcing one's own biases through recursive confirmation of negation.
*   **Purpose:** The goal is to *expose* the fragility of logic and meaning, not to assert a new, superior logic in its place.
