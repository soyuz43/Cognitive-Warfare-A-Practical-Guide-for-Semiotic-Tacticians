# Cognitive Overload

## Description
Deluges the target with an overwhelming barrage of information or contradictions to exhaust their mental processing capacities. The goal is not persuasion but saturation.

## Deployment Conditions
Effective against individuals or systems that rely on clarity, prioritization, or tempo-sensitive decision-making—such as journalists, academics, or grant review boards.

## Operational Use
Simultaneous release of contradictory data (e.g., white papers, policy briefs, PR statements), hypertrophied terminology, or incoherent citations. In advertising: rapid-switching visual overload. In academia: publication inflation with minimal epistemic yield.

## Effects
Mental fatigue, analytic paralysis, impaired judgment, dissociation from relevance hierarchies.

## Countermeasures
Information triage protocols, scheduled cognitive offloading, nested prioritization hierarchies.

## Institutional Example
Media outlets flood journalists with contradictory policy briefs to obscure truth. Academic systems overwhelm researchers with excessive publication demands, diluting focus.
