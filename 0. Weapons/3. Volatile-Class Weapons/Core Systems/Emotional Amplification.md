# Emotional Amplification

## Description
Triggers and intensifies emotional states to bypass rational cognition and induce reactionary behaviors.

## Deployment Conditions
Effective when emotional thresholds are poorly regulated, or when the target is already experiencing affective volatility—common in high-stress environments like media ecosystems or academic job markets.

## Operational Use
In advertising: urgency tactics, fear-driven framing (e.g., "last chance" sales). In academia: weaponized peer review, prestige anxiety, exclusion cloaked in moral panic.

## Effects
Panic loops, ego-attachment escalation, reactionary cognition override.

## Countermeasures
Meta-affective literacy, anticipatory affect dampening, group affective ventilation protocols.

## Institutional Example
Advertising uses fear-based urgency to drive impulsive purchases. Academic peer reviews exploit prestige anxiety to enforce conformity.
