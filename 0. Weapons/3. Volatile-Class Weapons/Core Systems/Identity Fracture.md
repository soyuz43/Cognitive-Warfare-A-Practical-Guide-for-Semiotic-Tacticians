# Identity Fracture

## Description
Introduces contradictory identity frames to disorient internal coherence and weaken agentic stability.

## Deployment Conditions
Effective on individuals with monolithic or rigid identity scripts—common in ideological institutions or personal branding cultures.

## Operational Use
In advertising: cultivating simultaneous consumer and rebel identities. In academia: demanding political neutrality while requiring moral signaling.

## Effects
Role confusion, personal dissonance, weakened capacity for strategic authenticity.

## Countermeasures
Identity layering protocols, intersectional coherence mapping, narrative axis realignment.

## Institutional Example
Advertisements promote conflicting consumer-rebel identities to destabilize self-perception. Academia demands neutrality while enforcing moral signaling, creating identity conflicts.
