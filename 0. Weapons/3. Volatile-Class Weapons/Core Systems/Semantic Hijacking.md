# Semantic Hijacking

## Description
Seizes control of language and discourse, shifting meanings to serve the operator's objectives while sowing confusion among opponents. Language becomes weaponized terrain, making coherence provisional and contestable.

## Deployment Conditions
Ideal against targets dependent on established narrative structures or linguistic frameworks for coherence—e.g., bureaucracies, academia, institutional media.

## Operational Use
Strategic alteration of key terms (e.g., redefining "objectivity," "freedom," or "rigor"), deliberate misuse of conceptual categories, framing manipulations. In advertising, this appears when "authenticity" becomes a performance cue. In academia, when "interdisciplinary" is used as a gatekeeping proxy for institutional allegiance.

## Effects
Misdirection, erosion of trust in communication, collapse of shared referential anchors, fragmentation of group consensus.

## Countermeasures
Enhanced semantic awareness training, critical linguistics, terminological reclamation protocols, establishment of local discourse anchors.

## Institutional Example
Advertising campaigns redefine "authenticity" to align with brand loyalty, undermining genuine self-expression. Academic institutions use "interdisciplinary" to enforce conformity while appearing innovative.
