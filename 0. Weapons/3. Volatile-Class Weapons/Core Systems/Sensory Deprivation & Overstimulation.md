# Sensory Deprivation/Overstimulation

## Description
Modulates sensory thresholds—either dampening or flooding channels—to induce processing instability.

## Deployment Conditions
Targets that require equilibrium in input processing—e.g., knowledge workers, educators, or designers.

## Operational Use
In advertising: fast-cut montages, overlayered audio-visual stimuli. In academia: digital fatigue, unreadable interfaces, hostile architectural design in institutional spaces.

## Effects
Input gating failure, memory fragmentation, dissociative perceptual states.

## Countermeasures
Sensory modulation scheduling, noise-dampening architectures, pattern-reducing ambient environments.

## Institutional Example
Advertising overwhelms with rapid-cut visuals to disrupt focus. Academic environments use cluttered digital interfaces and hostile spaces to induce fatigue.
