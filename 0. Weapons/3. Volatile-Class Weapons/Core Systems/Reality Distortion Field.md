# Reality Distortion Field

## Description
Constructs a semiotic environment where logic becomes non-binding and contradictions persist without collapse, forcing chronic doubt.

## Deployment Conditions
Effective on epistemically rigid systems (empirical, positivist) that cannot metabolize paradox without breakdown.

## Operational Use
In advertising: contradictory brand identities that appeal to all positions simultaneously. In academia: journals publishing antithetical frameworks without meta-commentary.

## Effects
Suspended trust in empirical coherence, lingering uncertainty, recursive paralysis.

## Countermeasures
Paradox literacy, epistemic pluralism scaffolding, recursive coherence training.

## Institutional Example
Brands adopt contradictory identities to appeal universally, undermining logic. Academic journals publish conflicting frameworks without resolution, fostering doubt.
