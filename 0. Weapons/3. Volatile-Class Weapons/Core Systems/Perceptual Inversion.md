# Perceptual Inversion

## Description
Temporarily distorts the target’s sensory or cognitive input to destabilize their grip on reality. The perceptual field becomes recursive, reflexive, or deliberately uncanny.

## Deployment Conditions
Effective against targets with heavy reliance on consistent perceptual cues—e.g., empirical scientists, rationalists, or logocentric discourse participants.

## Operational Use
In advertising: use of contradictory visual-verbal signals (e.g., minimalism to sell maximalism). In academic gatekeeping: promoting mutually exclusive research paradigms without acknowledging contradiction.

## Effects
Disorientation, cognitive self-skepticism, interruption of trust in sensory or rational input.

## Countermeasures
Grounding rituals, epistemic triangulation, sensory integrity mapping.

## Institutional Example
Advertisements use minimalist aesthetics to market excess, confusing consumer perception. Academic journals promote conflicting paradigms to destabilize empirical trust.
