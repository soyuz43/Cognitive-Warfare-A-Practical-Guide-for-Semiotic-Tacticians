# Narrative Collapse

## Description
Dismantles the internal story architecture by which individuals or institutions maintain continuity, legitimacy, and strategic direction.

## Deployment Conditions
Targets heavily reliant on origin myths or legacy narratives—e.g., religious institutions, universities, national identity structures.

## Operational Use
In advertising: deliberately invoking contradictory brand history. In academia: deconstruction of canon without offering new scaffolds.

## Effects
Strategic drift, moral disorientation, epistemic rootlessness.

## Countermeasures
Narrative rehabilitation rituals, multi-threaded sensemaking, continuity scaffold engineering.

## Institutional Example
Advertising contradicts brand history to confuse consumer loyalty. Academia deconstructs disciplinary canons without replacement, eroding legitimacy.
