# Temporal Disruption

## Description
Destabilizes the temporal sequencing of cognition—either through compression (urgency) or dilation (eternal deferral)—to impair planning, coherence, and cause-effect mapping.

## Deployment Conditions
Especially potent in contexts where strategic foresight or memory continuity is crucial—e.g., education, governance, funding timelines.

## Operational Use
In advertising: creating false urgency cycles (e.g., Black Friday anticipation in July). In academia: continuous rescheduling, moving goalposts for tenure or publication metrics.

## Effects
Displacement from present agency, inability to thread strategic continuity, psychological time-looping.

## Countermeasures
Ritual time-anchoring, narrative timeline reconstruction, temporal horizon reinforcement exercises.

## Institutional Example
Advertising induces false urgency with premature sales cycles. Academic institutions shift tenure criteria to disrupt long-term planning.
