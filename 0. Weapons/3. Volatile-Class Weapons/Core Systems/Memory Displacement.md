# Memory Displacement

## Description
Alters or implants memories to create internal contradictions in the target’s narrative coherence. This includes distortion of emotional resonance or motivational valence.

## Deployment Conditions
Most effective against targets with high narrative dependence—especially those with an autobiographical orientation, such as memoirists, public intellectuals, or values-driven professionals.

## Operational Use
In advertising: retrobranding campaigns that hijack personal nostalgia. In academia: mythologizing origin stories of disciplines to conceal power dynamics.

## Effects
Erosion of internal consistency, false alignment with inauthentic goals, destabilized memory-image coupling.

## Countermeasures
Autobiographical audit practices, collaborative memory-checks, critical historicization exercises.

## Institutional Example
Retrobranding campaigns evoke false nostalgia to align consumers with brand narratives. Academic disciplines mythologize origins to obscure institutional power dynamics.
