# Using Black Weapons — Field Calibration Addendum  
## *Semantic Drift Markers & Reflexive Stabilization Protocol*

---

### ✦ Classification

**Type:** Reflex Calibration Protocol  
**Tier:** Recursive Integrity / Operator Safety  
**Scope:** Mid-Operation Self-Assessment  
**Status:** Live Deployment Recommended  
**Requires:** Active recursion-awareness; symbolic self-mapping

---

### ⫸ Primary Function

To detect **ontological drift**, **identity contamination**, or **righteousness metastasis** during or after Black Weapon deployment.  
This protocol ensures the operator remains aligned to the core ethical frame described in the parent doctrine: **Recursive Self-Suspicion**, **Non-Accumulation**, and **Asymmetric Compassion**.

---

## ⫸ CALIBRATION SEQUENCE

---

### I. **Pulse Drift Detection**

> *"Is the strike still about the field? Or has it become about you?"*

Run this pulse-check:

- Have you replayed the rupture in your mind for satisfaction?  
- Are you narrativizing yourself as a figure within the rupture?  
- Is there a part of you that *wants to be seen*?

**If yes:**  
You are drifting from asymmetric compassion into egoic reinforcement.  
Initiate symbolic detachment loop: *“The field is not about me. I am not a protagonist. I am a conduit.”*

---

### II. **Echo Feedback Interference**

> *"Are you performing the rupture for its residue?"*

Check for trace behavior:

- Are you leaving behind cryptic artifacts for others to discover?  
- Are you seeding aftershocks purely for aesthetic or ideological resonance?

**If yes:**  
You are violating **Silent Containment**.  
Black weapons are not theater. **Silence is the second detonation.**  
Begin the containment ritual: strip all echoing phrases, memes, or symbols.

---

### III. **Recursive Signal Contamination**

> *"Have you begun to believe your own rupture justifies your frame?"*

Monitor recursive loopback:

- Are you citing the rupture as proof of your correctness?  
- Are you inferring virtue from the act of destabilization itself?

**If yes:**  
You are violating **Non-Accumulation**.  
There is no purity in the fracture. Let it go.  
Initiate signal disambiguation: decouple personal ego from structural insight.

---

### IV. **Affective Collapse Warning**

> *"Has your love become symbolic instead of embodied?"*

Anchor test:

- Is your compassion now an idea you perform rather than a sensation you feel?  
- Has the pre-linguistic tether been replaced by ideology?

**If yes:**  
You are operating with a **dead referent**.  
Return to embodied silence. Close your eyes. Touch the thing without words.  
You are no longer permitted to strike until it returns.

---

### V. **Symbolic Overexposure**

> *"Is your language beginning to outrun your self?"*

Semantic toxicity alert:

- Are your own terms becoming larger than you can feel?  
- Are you hiding inside the weapon's language?

**If yes:**  
You are decaying beneath your syntax.  
Evacuate the zone. Recover in silence.  
Ritually discard terminology that no longer maps to sensation.

---

## ⫸ Emergency Override

If **three or more** of these flags trigger in a single operation, you must **immediately exit the semiotic terrain** and:

- Cease use of all Black Weapons for a minimum of 72 hours.  
- Initiate [[Recursive Detoxification Protocols]].  
- Submit symbolic logs to a trusted co-operator or to your own cold cognition archive.  
- **Do not trust your perception of truth during cooldown.** Let drift settle.  

---

### ✦ Final Checkpoint

> “Can I still feel the thing before the words?  
> If I lost all my language, would I still know why I fight?”  

If the answer is no:  
You are not ready.  
Put the weapon down.  
Come back when the silence is stronger than the rupture.
