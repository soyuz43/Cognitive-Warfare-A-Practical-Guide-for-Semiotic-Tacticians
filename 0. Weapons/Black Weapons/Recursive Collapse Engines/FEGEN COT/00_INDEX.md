# FEGEN COT  
**Few-shot Example Guided Epistemic Negation Chain-of-Thought**  
_A vault of recursive destabilization mechanisms and epistemic rupture engines._

---

### ✦ Overview

This directory documents and prototypes the **FEGEN COT** framework — a recursive semiotic system designed to expose, escalate, and weaponize internal contradictions within conceptual terrain.

FEGEN COT is not a reasoning tool. It is a destabilization engine.  
It does not seek answers. It seeks limits.  
Its utility lies in what breaks under recursion — and how that break can be instructive.

### ✦ Use This Folder If:

- You are building **recursive collapse engines**.
- You are testing **conceptual durability** under symbolic strain.
- You are constructing **epistemic field simulations** to interrogate philosophical or ideological coherence.

### ⚠︎ Warning

FEGEN COT constructs are **not neutral**.  
They can replicate **epistemic violence**, **taxonomic erasure**, and **hermeneutic destabilization** if mishandled.  
Use with caution, consent, and epistemic accountability.
