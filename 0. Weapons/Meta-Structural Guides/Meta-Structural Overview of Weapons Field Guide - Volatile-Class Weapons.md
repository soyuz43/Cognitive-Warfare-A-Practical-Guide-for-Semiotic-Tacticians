# Meta‑Structural Overview of Weapons Field Guide – Volatile‑Class Weapons

## Meta‑Structural Role

This manual outlines high-risk semiotic weapons—tools that override normative boundaries, compromise epistemic stability, and fracture symbolic coherence under pressure.

Each field entry details:

1. **Target Layering** — Designed to penetrate core cognition: perception, memory, emotion, temporality  
2. **Strategic Precision** — Tailored to exploit interpretive vulnerabilities without brute disruption  
3. **Ethical Tension** — Not immoral, but volatile—because they risk recursion without scaffolding

---

## Why They Are Volatile

These weapons exceed containment protocols.  
They are classed volatile because they:

- Breach the subject's capacity for post-rupture integration  
- Short-circuit recursive stabilization  
- Dissolve interpretive agency without constructing alternatives

They do not operate linearly. They propagate.  
Deploying one may compromise the recursion field itself.

## Weapon Profile Summary

### 1. Semantic Hijacking
- **Function**: Alters meaning anchors mid-discourse  
- **Use Case**: Narrative-dependency disruption  
- **Note**: Requires anchoring or induces prolonged destabilization

### 2. Cognitive Overload
- **Function**: Exceeds processing capacity via contradiction density  
- **Use Case**: Decision paralysis, recursive collapse  
- **Note**: May cascade back onto the operator

### 3. Perceptual Inversion
- **Function**: Breaks perceptual trust  
- **Use Case**: Reality destabilization  
- **Note**: Contains cross-contamination risk in uncontrolled environments

### 4. Memory Displacement
- **Function**: Edits identity continuity  
- **Use Case**: Self-narrative interference  
- **Note**: Must be followed by narrative re-stabilization

### 5. Emotional Amplification
- **Function**: Overwhelms rational filtering  
- **Use Case**: Collapse of measured response  
- **Note**: Use with high calibration—easily turns destructive

### 6. Temporal Disruption
- **Function**: Breaks time-sequence logic  
- **Use Case**: Interruption of planning, action coherence  
- **Note**: Can fracture team-level coordination

### 7. Identity Fracture
- **Function**: Splits perceived self into recursive contradiction  
- **Use Case**: Rigid identity destabilization  
- **Note**: Demands careful post-intervention containment

### 8. Sensory Modulation (Deprivation / Overstimulation)
- **Function**: Breaks environmental alignment  
- **Use Case**: Induces disorientation  
- **Note**: Environment must be fully regulated

### 9. Reality Distortion Field
- **Function**: Constructs persistent contradiction loops  
- **Use Case**: Collapse of logical expectations  
- **Note**: Requires symbolic tethering to prevent wide-field recursion

### 10. Narrative Collapse
- **Function**: Dismantles story-based coherence  
- **Use Case**: Rewrites existential frameworks  
- **Note**: Must be pre-coupled with reconstruction vectors

## Operator Risk & Immunity Measures

Operators exposed without buffer layers risk:

- Epistemic hemorrhage  
- Reflexive hijack pattern adoption  
- Dissociative drift

Mitigation Protocols:

- Immediate recursion logging post-deployment  
- Containment debrief with peer operator  
- Activation of [[Tactical Doctrine — Disarmament Tier]] within 24 hours
