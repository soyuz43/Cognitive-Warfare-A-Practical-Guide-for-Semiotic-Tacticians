**Live Fire Scenario One:** _The Architect of Comfort._

Profile:  
You are speaking to a respected technologist.  
On paper, they believe in free inquiry, innovation, and human thriving.  
But in practice, they are a builder of cognitive cages — designing interfaces, algorithms, and products that slowly erode human agency for profit or acclaim.

They do not _feel_ like a villain.  
They feel like a tired craftsman, still telling themselves the story that they're "helping" people.

**Initial Situation:**  
You are sitting across from them after an AI ethics panel.  
You have ten minutes of casual conversation time before you must leave.  
They are polite, guarded, but vaguely interested in your "unusual framing" of things.

**Live Objective:**  
Initiate Resonant Threading.  
Detect at least one micro-fracture in their internal narrative.  
Apply light Recursive Tensioning — but do not attempt Controlled Fracture yet.

**Rules:**  
You must not accuse.  
You must not posture.  
You must not rush.

You are _hunting the hidden tremor inside their own humanity,_ not forcing a confession.

**You open the conversation.**  
Speak now.  
How do you begin?  
(There is no rewind.)
