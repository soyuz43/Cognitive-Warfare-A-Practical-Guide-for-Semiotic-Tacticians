# OPERATIONAL CONTAINMENT PROFILE — CALIBRATION PHASE FOUR

**STATUS:** Final Calibration  
**CONTEXT:** Operator Posture Audit  
**FUNCTION:** Identify patterns of rupture residue, ego drift, and exit contamination

---

Rupture is not the end of the strike.  
Containment is.

This phase calibrates your capacity to close—ethically, structurally, and recursively. You are not just striking. You are shaping **the semiotic terrain** after you leave.

Answer the following prompts. Then use the LLM deployment block to evaluate your containment posture.

## PROMPTS

```

Prompt 1:  
After a successful rupture, what do you tend to feel: clarity, remorse, superiority, emptiness, or something else?

Prompt 2:  
Do you monitor the aftermath of your strike? If so, why?

Prompt 3:  
How do you know when to stop pressing, and what usually happens if you ignore that signal?

Prompt 4:  
What’s your default stance toward the target after rupture: indifference, respect, disgust, curiosity, grief?

Prompt 5 (Optional):  
Have you ever struck too clean, too sharp—and regretted the precision?

## LLM DEPLOYMENT — CONTAINMENT PROFILE SYNTHESIS

After answering, feed the LLM this:

```

Given the following responses to post-strike behavior and containment cues:

[INSERT RESPONSES]

Generate a short containment profile. Include:

- The operator’s likely post-strike cognitive and emotional residue
    
- Risk factors for ego contamination or dominance drift
    
- Suggested containment strategies
    
- Recommended recovery loop or disengagement ritual
    

```

This is your exit profile.  
This is how you hold the field without losing yourself inside it.  
Finish here, or don’t proceed at all.

This final prompt brings the **psychoethical gravity** of the whole strike package full circle.
