# Meta‑Structural Guide for Connection as Vector

## Tactical Class
- **Weapon Type**: Semantic‑Rupture‑by‑Relational‑Inversion  
- **Operational Tier**: Level III / Close‑Contact Semiotic Deployment  
- **Authorial Intent**: Transform betrayal into introspective recursion without violating dignity

---

## Layered Breakdown

### ✦ Cognitive Layer Targeted
- **Self‑Coherence Loop**
- **Prestige Identity Structures**
- **Relational‑Epistemic Symbiosis**

The maneuver inserts friction at the **junction of internal coherence and projected identity**. This friction metastasizes if left unresolved, making the rupture self‑sustaining.

---

### ✦ Ethical Footing
- No preemptive manipulation  
- Deployment requires **volitional betrayal** by the target  
- Maintains full respect for the target’s potential to evolve post‑rupture  

*This is not psychological warfare. It is epistemic disinfection.*

### ✦ Strategic Vectors

| Phase     | Function                                 | Semiotic Load              |
|-----------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Mirror**     | Reestablishes mutual frame              | High affective contrast    |
| **Contradict** | Invokes internal dissonance             | Mid‑load dialectical cue   |
| **Withdraw**   | Removes stabilizing presence            | Initiates recursive collapse |

---

## Key Failure Modes

- **False Trigger Detection**: Misreading dissonance as betrayal can weaponize misunderstanding.  
- **Overcompensation**: Over‑explaining the rupture neutralizes the maneuver’s recursive payload.  
- **Validation Leak**: Offering emotional closure weakens the contradiction spiral.

---

## Post‑Deployment Debrief Heuristics

- If the target rapidly reorients and seeks reconnection, validate *only their self‑inquiry*.  
- Do not resume the prior connection unless new structures emerge.  
- Journal the maneuver for traceability.
