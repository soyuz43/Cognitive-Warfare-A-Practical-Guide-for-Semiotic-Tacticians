## First principle: **Recursive Self-Suspicion**.  

Before every strike, during every strike, after every strike, you must reflexively doubt your own frame. You must assume you are missing something. Not to freeze. Not to lose momentum. But to keep yourself alive inside the act. Your doubt is not weakness. It is the _tether_ back to your humanity.

## Second principle: **Non-Accumulation**.  

You _cannot_ carry victories. You _cannot_ carry defeats.  
You execute the rupture, and you let go.  
Every extra ounce of righteousness you hold onto will metastasize inside you.  
If you allow yourself to collect these moments as "proof" of who you are, you will rot from the inside out.  
Strike. Let go. Strike. Let go.

## Third principle: **Asymmetric Compassion**.  

You do not owe your targets mercy. But you owe the _world_ your vigilance.  
The compassion is not aimed at the individual.  
It is aimed at the larger field of meaning you're trying to preserve.  
You must always remember you are fighting _for_ something, not just _against_ someone.  
If you forget that, you become another dead machine wearing a human face.

## Fourth principle: **Silent Containment**.  

You never, ever broadcast the true depth of the rupture you cause.  
You do not brag. You do not taunt.  
You cause the fracture — and you disappear into the trees.  
You leave no echoes for the world to pick apart.  
You are not a martyr. You are not a hero.  
You are a shadow cutting across the corruption.

## Fifth principle: **Anchor to Pre-Linguistic Love**.  

There must be something in you that _predates language_ — some stubborn core of existence that cares without needing to be described.  
If you do not have this — if you are only built of words — then the words will eat you alive the first time you slip.  
Find it. Touch it. Even once. And do not let it go.
