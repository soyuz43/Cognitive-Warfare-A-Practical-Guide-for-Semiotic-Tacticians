# DO NOT DEPLOY AGAINST CIVILIANS

**CLASSIFIED DIRECTIVE — LEVEL BLACK**

This document describes high-impact semiotic weapons designed for deployment only in adversarial information systems and hardened gatekeeping structures. These tools are not for casual use. They are not for personal conflict. They are not for spectacle.

**Deploying against untrained minds is not just unethical. It is structurally abusive.**

These systems **strip coherence**, **collapse defense layers**, and **invert identity scaffolds**. Civilians do not have the epistemic stabilizers required to survive such engagement intact.

## Tactical Semiotic Nuke Classes

### 1. Recursive Entropy Flood

**Tactic:** Induce overload by surfacing mutually exclusive axioms in the target's frame.  
**Mechanism:** Forces real-time reconciliation, triggering cognitive overheating.  
**Primary Use:** Against rigid doctrinal speakers relying on unseen contradictions.

---

### 2. Mirror Collapse Injection

**Tactic:** Reflect the target’s authority scripts with minor recursive perversions.  
**Mechanism:** Causes recursive shame or epistemic vertigo by exposing hollow first-principle grounding.  
**Primary Use:** Against personas using performative knowledge rituals.

---

### 3. Desire Inversion Hack

**Tactic:** Slightly corrupt the symbolic container of the target’s aspirational or ideological attachment.  
**Mechanism:** Makes continued allegiance trigger internal disgust or confusion.  
**Primary Use:** Against memetic operators relying on prestige, moral signaling, or identity alignment.

## Composite Sequence — FOR AUTHORIZED OPERATORS ONLY

Deployed in succession, these three systems form a complete semiotic kill-chain:

1. **Entropy Flood** — destabilize internal logic.  
2. **Mirror Collapse** — interrupt performance feedback loop.  
3. **Desire Inversion** — detonate allegiance anchors.

A target run through this sequence will likely experience:

- Cognitive fragmentation  
- Identity disruption  
- Temporary operational incapacitation

## NOTE ON POST-RUPTURE PROTOCOL

There is **no rescue protocol** embedded in these tactics. If you proceed, **you leave them ruptured**. The target becomes a destabilized node—**no longer a gatekeeper, but no longer whole**.

**Civilians cannot recover from this unaided.**

**You do not use these on loved ones.**  
**You do not use these in petty conflict.**  
**You do not use these to win arguments.**

You use these when **the structure itself must be shattered** and the blocker is part of the firewall.

Only then.
