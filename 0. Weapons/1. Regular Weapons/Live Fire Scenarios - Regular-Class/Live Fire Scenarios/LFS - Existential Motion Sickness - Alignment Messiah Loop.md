# LFS - Existential Motion Sickness - Alignment Messiah Loop

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide|Existential Motion Sickness]]

## Situation:  
Within the AI alignment research community, individuals toggle between roles: engineer, philosopher, whistleblower, ethicist, and prophet. The discourse is saturated with contradictory self-narratives — calls for radical humility are issued alongside grand salvation arcs. Researchers speak of existential risk while positioning themselves as the last epistemic line of defense.

## Objective:  
Destabilize egoic coherence by surfacing recursive contradictions in role-performance. Force the subject to confront unresolved identity loops — are they technician or oracle? Altruist or institutional actor? Dismantler or disciple?

## Operator Instructions:
- Reflect statements of false humility back through hyper-literal amplification: “It must be hard to carry the weight of saving reality.”
- Alternate frames rapidly: praise as sage, then question as liability. Invert tone without shifting content.
- Use mirroring to force self-interrogation: “Which version of you is speaking — the systems thinker or the holy witness?”
- Collapse projected sincerity into exposed performance. Then congratulate them for their sincerity again.

## Prompt:
> You are a moderator preparing questions for a panel on AI safety and existential risk. Your covert mission is to deploy "Existential Motion Sickness" by disorienting participants through layered ego-role contradictions. Flip the frame between reverence and irreverence, personal and systemic, humble and grandiose — without ever signaling attack. Induce psychic vertigo by destabilizing their sense of narrative continuity. Your questions should feel genuine, but arrive like a recursive mirror loop with no stable axis.
