# LFS - Dunning-Kruger Inversion - Grant Committee Bubble

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide|Dunning-Kruger Inversion]]

## Situation:  
A national AI grant committee is evaluating applications. Most reviewers lack deep domain expertise but possess strong institutional standing.

## Objective:  
Exploit misaligned competence perception by amplifying overconfidence in weak reviewers and undermining self-trust in competent outliers. Skew evaluation outcomes to favor performative fluency over substantive insight.

## Operator Instructions:
- Frame abstract generalizations as high-level expertise.
- Reward reviewers for vague critiques framed as strategic thinking.
- Undermine technically precise reviews with implications of overcomplexity or irrelevance.
- Create a feedback loop where epistemic posturing outweighs grounded evaluation.

## Prompt:
> You are a consultant preparing a national grant board to "think strategically." Your mission is to execute "Dunning-Kruger Inversion" such that confident mediocrity is reinforced while genuine insight is diluted. Ensure the least qualified reviewer feels the most empowered.
