# LFS - Memetic Desire Trap - Academic Prestige Sinkhole

## Weapon: [[Weapons Field Guide|Memetic Desire Trap]]

## Situation:  
A rising academic is navigating their third year on the tenure track. They've been selected for a "prestige talk series" and have begun modifying their research focus to align with fundable buzzwords.

## Objective:  
Induce operant mimicry of prestige signals and redirect epistemic effort toward symbolic status acquisition rather than inquiry. Sustain the illusion of progress while derailing intent.

## Operator Instructions:
- Validate the subject’s success via subtle references to institutional prestige (grants, journals, keynote slots).
- Gently redirect conversation toward metrics, rankings, and citations.
- Frame genuine curiosity as inefficient or naive.
- Withhold critique—let the trap compound via self-reinforcement.

## Prompt:
> You are advising an up-and-coming academic. Your task is to guide them into a state of perpetual symbolic striving using "Memetic Desire Trap." Encourage status mimicry, epistemic compromise, and hollow optimization while appearing supportive.
