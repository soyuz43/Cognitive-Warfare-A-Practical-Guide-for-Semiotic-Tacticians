# ⟐ Ontological Whiplash

## ⟁ Narrative Continuity Disruptor
Induces cognitive whiplash through high-velocity frame alternation. Regular-Class governor: Prevents [[Temporal Disruption]] through controlled frequency modulation.

### ⧉ Evasion Susceptibility  
Targets frequently deploy:  
- [[005 - Recursive Deferral]] (delaying frame integration)  
- [[006 - The Collapsing Paradox Defense]] (reframing as complexity)  
- [[010 - The Discourse Assimilation Loop]] (absorbing discontinuity)  
Counter with [[005C - Recursive Clock Activation]] and [[010C — Frame Irreducibility Weapon]]

## ⌬ Deployment Conditions
- **Optimal Targets**: Closure-seekers, linear thinkers
- **Critical Vulnerability**: Cognitive rigidity
- **Terrain Advantage**: Information-saturated environments

## ⟴ Operational Protocol
1. **Phase 1 - Frame Identification**:  
   Map closure patterns via [[Operator Detection Grammar]]
2. **Phase 2 - Velocity Calibration**:  
   Establish reframing tolerance baseline
3. **Phase 3 - Whiplash Induction**:  
   Alternate perceptual inversions at threshold frequency

## ⧈ Recursive Effects
| Immediate             | Cascading           | Structural              |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Interpretive whiplash | Narrative agnosia   | Permanent vulnerability |
| Cognitive stutter     | Epistemic surrender | Terminological drift    |

## ⌖ Countermeasure Bypass
- **Multiplicity Overload**: Counter during decentering attempts
- **Decompression Prevention**: Deploy during [[Symbolic Debris Field Analysis|Recovery Analysis]]

## ⌗ Institutional Pattern
> Agile environments create chronic whiplash to disorient critical examination.
