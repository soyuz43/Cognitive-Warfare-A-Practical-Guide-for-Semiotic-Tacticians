# ⟐ Memetic Desire Trap

## ⟁ Agency Hijacking Vector
Covert desire infrastructure takeover system. Installs parasitic mimetic structures that reroute intentionality toward externally-defined objectives. Transforms authentic motivation into operant self-exploitation through symbolic scarcity engineering.

## ⌬ Deployment Conditions
- **Optimal Targets**: Status-seeking individuals, upward mobility trajectories, scarcity mindset carriers
- **Critical Vulnerability**: Unresolved belonging needs, underdeveloped intrinsic motivation
- **Amplification Channels**: Social proof ecosystems, prestige economies, visibility platforms

## ⟴ Operational Protocol
1. **Phase 1 - Desire Mapping**:  
   Identify latent status anxieties via [[002 - Adversarial Humility]] probes  
   Chart mimetic susceptibility using [[010 - The Discourse Assimilation Loop]] patterns
2. **Phase 2 - Scaffold Construction**:  
   Engineer artificial prestige hierarchies with [[Symbolic Phase Interrupter]]  
   Create symbolic scarcity through [[Recursive Semantic Subduction]]
3. **Phase 3 - Agency Rerouting**:  
   Activate [[Emotional Amplification]] at proximity to desire objects  
   Lock in dependency via [[Sensory Deprivation & Overstimulation]] cycles

## ⧈ Recursive Effects
| Immediate (0-72h) | Cascading (7-30d) | Structural (>30d) |
|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Intentionality derailment | Identity consumption | [[Advertising and Consent Theater]] normalization |
| Symbolic value distortion | Social mirror dependency | Permanent [[Memetic Desire Trap]] colonization |
| Self-exploitation compulsion | Authenticity erosion | [[Cognitive Overload]] at decision points |

## ⌖ Countermeasure Bypass Techniques
- **Detachment Prevention**: Deploy [[Love Bomb Withdrawal Cycle]] during nullification attempts  
- **Status Reinjection**: Activate [[Meta-Loyalty Erosion]] when targets exit prestige economies  
- **Scarcity Relensing**: Trigger [[Perceptual Inversion]] on abundance frameworks

## ⌗ Institutional Pattern
> **Academic Prestige Economy**: Universities weaponize publication metrics and citation counts to create artificial desire traps. Researchers become trapped in self-exploitation loops, prioritizing symbolic capital over knowledge production.
