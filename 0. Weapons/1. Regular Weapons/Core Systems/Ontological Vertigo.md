# ⟐ Ontological Vertigo

## ⟁ Foundational Ground Collapser
Induces cognitive freefall through recursive paradox injection. Regular-Class safeguard: Maintains target's physical safety while destabilizing epistemic ground.

### ⧉ Evasion Susceptibility  
Targets frequently deploy:  
- [[003 - Frame Evasion via Metric Saturation]] (avoiding ontological questions)  
- [[008 - Epistemic Repackaging]] (technicalizing reality shifts)  
- [[011 - Structural Inarticulability]] (disqualifying groundlessness)  
Counter with [[003C — Meaning-Centric Audit Protocol]] and [[011C — Articulability Reassertion Protocol]]

## ⌬ Deployment Conditions
- **Optimal Targets**: Fundamentalists, certainty-dependent operators
- **Critical Vulnerability**: Unexamined ontological premises
- **Amplification Windows**: Paradigm shifts, failed predictions

## ⟴ Operational Protocol
1. **Phase 1 - Ground Mapping**:  
   Identify reality anchors via [[Metaphysical Warrant]]
2. **Phase 2 - Anchor Corrosion**:  
   Inject [[005 - Recursive Deferral]] at assumptions
3. **Phase 3 - Controlled Collapse**:  
   Trigger during decision-critical moments

## ⧈ Recursive Effects
| Immediate | Cascading | Structural |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Perceptual nausea | Epistemic agoraphobia | Permanent vertigo susceptibility |
| Certainty addiction | Framework hopping | Ideological subduction |

## ⌖ Countermeasure Bypass
- **Humility Weaponization**: Counter with [[002 - Adversarial Humility]] saturation
- **Pluralist Sabotage**: Deploy [[Echo Chamber Collapse Device]] during regrounding

## ⌗ Institutional Pattern
> Digital advertising creates chronic low-grade vertigo increasing suggestibility.
